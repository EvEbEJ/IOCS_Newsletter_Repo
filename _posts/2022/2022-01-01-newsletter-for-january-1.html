        Amber - Sticky Situation
        </h2>

          <p>
            The first passage we’re looking at is not even in Genesis! It’s in Exodus 20:8-11:
          </p>
          <p>“Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy. <b>Six days</b> you shall labor, and do all your work,
            but the seventh day is a Sabbath to the Lord your God.
            On it you shall not do any work, you, or your son, or your daughter, your male servant, or your female servant,
            or your livestock, or the sojourner who is within your gates.
            For <b>in six days</b> the Lord made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that is in them,
            and rested on the seventh day. Therefore the Lord blessed the Sabbath day and made it holy.”
          </p>
          <p>
            The two times the phrase ‘six days’ appears here are parallel.
            The first occurrence, as with the rest of the Ten Commandments, is obviously literal.
            God is commanding the Israelites to work on six days of the seven-day week.
            The second occurrence is where the dispute begins. Is “day” literal, figurative, or metaphorical?
            In this case, it has to be literal because of the context, so a paraphrase would be:
            “You shall work six literal days and rest on the seventh because God created the world in six literal days and rested on the seventh.”
          </p>
          <p>
            The second passage is a snippet of Genesis 1. Verse 5 says, “God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night.
            And there was evening and there was morning, the first day.” The last sentence is repeated over and over again. It is easily overlooked.
            However, there is a meaning to it, especially in relating to the
            <a href="https://talkiocs.blogspot.com/2021/03/theistic-evolution-bible-part-1.html" style="color:dodgerblue">six-day creation</a>.
            Every time evening and morning are mentioned along with the Hebrew word for day,
            it denotes a literal, 24-hour day. In addition, every other time in the Bible an ordinal number
            (e.g. “first,” “second,” etc.) is mentioned before the Hebrew “day,” it refers to a normal, literal day.<sup style="font-size:10px">1</sup>

            There are many, many fossilized animals trapped in amber. Among them are insects, scorpions, bird legs, mammal hairs, and even lizards!
            Lizards especially help disprove amber's solidifying time. While the hardening is rather quick because of the chemical reactions
            (we know the reactions today, and since we observe them in the present, they are true facts),
            animals entombed in amber nail the fact that amber does not take even more than a year to dry.
            If a lizard happened to be climbing into a tree wound and got trapped in some resin, couldn't it escape? Additionally,
            if any animal had been stuck, it would decay quickly, because, according to evolution, the time of dinosaurs was very humid and warm,
            perfect conditions for decomposers. Also, even if an animal had been totally covered in resin, and it hardened, it continues decaying.
            If the decay continues for millions of years, we would only find imprints in amber! In fact,
            scientists have even made an injection into an amber victim and extracted living bacteria!
            How can bacteria survive for millions of years? Also, how can they not have broken down the animal? Scientists have examined
            "amberized" termites and found protozoans that were identical to those in the stomach of termites today! No evolution occurred!
            Isn't that surprising?
          </p>
          <p>
            Aquatic insects, algae, and plankton have even been found encased! Some scientists did experiments,
            and they discovered that if resin flows into water, it stays liquid a bit longer. This allows the chance of aquatic creatures to be fossilized.
            Suppose that there was a huge flood, which broke many trees in pieces, some of which produced amber. Could the sea creatures have been trapped in that event?
            It seems likely.
          </p>
          <p>
            Therefore, even amber, just non-living, hardened tree resin, can disprove evolution. How much more complicated objects can do! God truly cares for each one of His creations,
            and each one reflects the credibility of His word.
          </p>

            the sea lily (<i>Crinoidea</i>) and the sea star (<i>Asteroidea</i>). This doesn’t appear to be plausible, does it?

            During this period, 85% of all life supposedly died on earth. This implies that only 15% of all life during the first mass extinction survived.
            The Ordovician-Silurian extinction is said to be the second greatest mass extinction on earth.
            This extinction is suggested to be caused by toxic metals including iron, arsenic, and lead released on the earth,
            posing a threat to all marine life. This would also put sea stars and sea lilies at risk.
            Yet even according to National Geographic, evidence is lacking for the Ordovician-Silurian extinction.<sup style="font-size:10px">2</sup>
          </p>
          <h2>Devonian Extinction</h2>
          <p class="indent">
            Evolution claims that the Devonian extinction took place around 383 million years ago and lasted 20 million years.
            During this period, it is said that 75% of all life on earth, meaning only 25% of life survived.
            Somehow, both of the echinoderms, sea stars and sea lilies, are still hanging in there.
            The Devonian extinction is said to have occurred as a result of volcanic activities.
            Greenhouse gases such as sulfur dioxide could have contributed, as well as asteroid compacts.
            One compact, the Siljan crater in Sweden, is 32 miles wide.
            Occurring 377 million years ago, this crash into the earth is also credited to the Devonian extinction.
            Still, these dates and the blame of the Devonian extinction are not credible, and could be, and probably are false labels.
          </p>
          <h2>Permian-Triassic Extinction</h2>
          <p>
            Then, 252 million years ago, Evolution says the Permian-Triassic extinction took place.
            This is claimed to be the greatest mass extinction of all time. It is said that 96% of all marine life perished.
            Could sea stars and sea lilies really make that 4%? The Siberian Traps, found in Siberia, were a huge volcanic complex,
            which spewed out 720,000 cubic miles of lava.
            This eruption is assumedly credited to a large portion of the Permian-Triassic extinction.
            The seawater supposedly rose to 104 degrees Fahrenheit!
            Sea stars and sea lilies must have undergone massive adaptations to match Evolution’s expectations.
            Some features of the Permian-Triassic extinction could be slightly realistic, but the dates are complete fiction.
          </p>
          <h2>Cretaceous-Paleogene Extinction</h2>
          <p>
            The Cretaceous-Paleogene extinction is said to be the most recent mass extinction. Taking place 66 million years ago, about 76% of all life died.
            This 24% must still include the sea star and the sea lily. It is said that an asteroid seven and a half miles wide crashed into the earth,
            leaving a crater 120 miles wide in what is now the Yucatan Peninsula. Contrary to the other mass extinctions,
            global cooling actually occurred as a result of the dust from the compact.
            We do have evidence for the crater in the Yucatan Peninsula, which is now called the Chicxulub crater.
            But the compact made by the crater’s owner is exaggerated by Evolution.<sup style="font-size:10px">3</sup>
          </p>
          <h2>Out of the mist, Sea Lily and Sea Star?</h2>
          <p>
            Out of these 5 mass extinctions, we see that a great majority of life supposedly dies. Now, it’s time to get mathematical.
            In the Ordovician-Silurian extinction (445 - 415 mya), it is claimed that 85% of life died, meaning only 15% survived.
            In the Devonian extinction (383 mya), supposedly 75% of life was cleared, which means 25% remained.
            In the Permian-Triassic extinction (252 mya), it is presumed that 96% of life perished, implying that only 4% eluded extinction!
            In the Triassic-Jurassic extinction (201 mya), 80% of life is said to have fallen, telling us only 20% was spared.
            In the Cretaceous-Paleogene extinction (66 mya), 76% of all life was proposed to be eliminated by natural selection,
            which leads to 24%, which escaped death. And supposedly, both the sea star and sea lily survived all five mass extinctions!
            This is improbable. The chance of this happening for even one of these creatures escaping these mass extinctions is only 0.072%!
            Then, if we pile onto that, the fact that both sea lilies and sea stars passed through the wrath of these science-called extinctions,
            the probability is zero. Clearly, these monstrous dates and time periods are not mathematical and are incredulously unscientific.
          </p>
          <h2>The Truth & Conclusion</h2>
          <p>
            In reality, backed up by scientific evidence, there were never five mass extinctions.
            Evolution’s way of clearing the earth of its inhabitants is clearly an unscientific philosophy of deceit.
            From a Biblical perspective, it is also evident that all creation only existed for a few thousand years.
            This would include earth, the universe, and all that God made.
            Sea lilies and sea stars have always been sea lilies and sea stars since God set them on the earth. Genesis 1:24 says:
          </p>
          <p>
            “<i>And God said, “Let the earth bring forth living creatures according to their kinds—livestock
              and creeping things and beasts of the earth according to their kinds.” And it was so.</i>”<sup style="font-size:10px">4</sup>
          </p>
          <p>
            Sea stars and sea lilies are creations of God;
            they will never be anything else nor transition to anything other than the echinoderms that they are.
            God made everything good. There was no need for millions of years. No overdoses of greenhouse gases.
            No wipe-out-nearly-all-animal-kind event (except Genesis 6-8). None of the sort!
            All of these are unscientific statements added from the Evolutionary book of fiction science.
            We must “be alert and of sober-mind…”<sup style="font-size:10px">5</sup> as commanded in 1 Peter 5:8 from the deceptions of the world,
            until the day when God will once again make all things “very good.”<sup style="font-size:10px">6</sup>

              Troodon - Although this dino was a "big brain," its intelligence is dwarfed by humans.
            </p>
          </div><!---->
          <p>
            <i>Troodon</i> (Greek for the “wounding tooth”)<sup style="font-size:10px">1</sup> was first discovered in fossil form by Joseph Leidy in 1856.
            It was not until the 1900s that fragments of the hands, feet, and tails were unearthed from various American locations.
            Even so, when first discovered, these parts were assigned to the wrong genus and were called the “Stenonychosaurus.”
          </p>
          <p>
            It is clear that the Troodon has some pretty unique stuff. The Troodon was probably an omnivore.
            The Troodon’s brain may have been larger than most dinosaurs.
            It is claimed these reptiles supposedly have evolved a level of human intelligence!
            Troodons are fallaciously classified as some 77 million-year-old creatures.
            In reality, these dinosaurs roamed the earth with humans ever since the beginning about 6000 years ago.
            Obviously, the Troodon is a creature to admire and praise our God about.
            This should bring us comfort and exaltation to our lips because we know that God created us
            to be more and values us more than even these 75-pound beasts!
          </p>
          <!--<p style="margin-left:40px; margin-right:40px;">
            <sup style="font-size:10px">15</sup> Behold, Behemoth,

            <sup style="font-size:10px">16</sup> Behold, his strength in his loins,

            This would probably be a large dinosaur, perhaps Apatosaurus. In verse 17, the Behemoth’s tail is compared to a cedar tree.
            No animal living today meets that description.

          What’s the Deal With Carbon Dating?
          </h2>

          <p>
            If you have been involved in Evolution discourse at any point in time, you have probably heard the phrase ‘Carbon Dating’ thrown around a couple times.
            This article will tackle what Carbon Dating is, its reliability, and why it is so important to evolution discussions.
          </p>
          <p>
            Carbon dating is a method scientists use to predict the age of a dead organism.
            Here is how it works: When an organism is alive, it consumes carbon. Most of this carbon is carbon-12,
            which has a stable amount of neutrons. However, some carbon is an unstable isotope of carbon made from nitrogen-14
            in the upper atmosphere. This isotope is called Carbon-14. When an organism dies, it stops consuming carbon,
            and carbon-14 decays back into nitrogen-14 by emitting beta particles. Scientists measure the number of beta particles emitted and calculate,
            using the assumed rate of carbon-14’s decay, the age of the organisms.
          </p>
          <p>
            Of course, just from reading that summary many caveats and loopholes are visible.
            Carbon-14 dating doesn’t work on mussels or any other organism that hasn’t been exposed to carbon,
            because their beta radiation levels when freshly killed are at the levels of trees that have been dead for centuries.
            Radiation levels in coal, oil, and other gasses are so low, their Carbon-14 levels are also not reliable.
            However, one organism remains accurately dated by carbon dating: Trees.
            But, even some tree readings have been proven false, because the fundamental premise of carbon-14 dating is flawed.
          </p>
          <p>
            Carbon dating is predicated on the assumption that the rate of carbon decay has remained constant over the years - which is untrue.
            The amount of carbon-14 in the atmosphere fluctuates throughout the years. Fossil fuels and nuclear bomb tests also skew carbon dating results.
            As scientists study how carbon decay works, they re-evaluate carbon-dating discoveries.
            For instance, Siberia’s earliest human fossils have been shown to be at least 1,000 years younger than originally thought.
          </p>
          <p>
            The most important part of this article has to do with what carbon dating has to do with evolution.
            As many readers of this article will know, the Bible teaches that the Earth was made in six days.
            Although some Christians interpret this passage of Genesis as a metaphor and not literal teaching,
            all Christians can agree that God created each living creature intelligently and deliberately.
            The Theory of Evolution would argue otherwise. The Geological Time Scale, supported by Evolution,
            dates the earth back to 4.67 billion years ago when life first began. A few million years later,
            Archaea and protists form, and Oxygen from photosynthesis is first released into the air.
            After the Cambrian explosion, an era where scientists date the majority of invertebrate fossils,
            all the rest of living creatures evolve from these primitive, billion-year-old creatures.
          </p>
          <p>
            The problem is not that the process took billions of years, or even that carbon dating is used to extrapolate this evidence.
            The problem arises when carbon dating is used to justify the Darwinian idea that all of creation evolved from a single organism.
          </p>
          <p>
            Evolutionists explain that the Theory of Evolution does not explain the origin of life, and therefore Creationists and Evolutionists should co-exist peacefully.
            However, they simplify their own theory. The Theory of Evolution states that all organisms evolved from a single life force.
            It posits that all living creatures were created by means of natural selection, rather than intelligently by a Designer.
            The Theory of Evolution does not merely introduce the concepts of natural selection and survival of the fittest,
            it assumes that the world began from a single life force. They don’t know who created the life force,
            but they believe that it existed before anything else did, and created every living thing we know today.
          </p>
          <p>
            So what really is the problem with carbon dating? Nothing. It’s a process that dates fossils back to their origin with varying success.
            Like science, religion, and anything else, the problem arises when scientists rely on one tool when they really should try another.

          They're everywhere. Literally.<sup style="font-size:10px;">1</sup>
          While Squirrels (<i>Sciuridae</i>)<sup style="font-size:10px;">2,3,4</sup> are considered by many as pests,
          they certainly are one of God’s most fascinating and agile creatures.
          They are recognized for their long and bushy tails, which are, in fact, almost half their body length!<sup style="font-size:10px;">5</sup>
          They can effortlessly leap from tree to tree, often playing with others and hunting on the ground.
          Squirrels dwell everywhere - in forests, cities, and suburbs - any place with a tree and food is a place for a squirrel.
          Their nests (dreys) are constructed by a variety of artifacts, including twigs, leaves, and plastic bags.
        </p>
        <p>
          The squirrel is indeed a wonderful animal in many ways,
          but perhaps the most unique characteristic of the squirrel is its importance to the environment.
          As well as pests, squirrels are definitely wonderful gardeners too. Eastern Gray Squirrels are notorious for burying acorns.
          Each fall, these 1-pound squirrels dig holes in the ground to store up food for the winter.
          Squirrels embed almost 10,000 acorns in the ground each fall, that's burying about 110 acorns a day!
          Clearly, if the <i>Ants and the Grasshopper</i> had a squirrel inside, it'll be on the side of the Ants.
          Despite their bright mind and busy schedule over the fall, they forget up to 74% of the nuts they buried.<sup style="font-size:10px;">6</sup>
          This may be a bummer to the hard-working squirrels, but without squirrels, many of the oak trees around the US would not exist.

          Incredibly, the <i>Sciuridae</i> is not just another <i>Sciuridae</i>. It is a wonderful creature fashioned by God.
          Created on the sixth day of Creation, these seemingly dull animals display in vivid ways the wonder and perfectness of
          God’s masterpieces, until they devise a master plan of how to rob the contents of your birdfeeder.

            It is always important to know what you are doing. It is also important to let others know what you are doing.
            IOCS has been doing a lot, for example, in our newsletter we feature photos, articles, and more.
            But is that the IOCS' goal? To take photos or to defeat evolution?
          </p>
          <p class="indent">
            The answer to those questions is a definite <b>no</b>. We are not here to show what we can do, what we can accomplish.
            For if we were, we could not and would not survive very long. And even if we did, our photos and articles will have no power.
            They would be empty.
          </p>
          <p class="indent">
            But our primary focus is to glorify God in all that we do. For we can do anything with God’s strength (Philippians 4:13).
            God is the one on whom we are looking to all times.
          </p>
          <p class="indent">
            This is a reminder and reaffirmation both to IOCS members and to our readers.
            We are not here to elevate ourselves or our organization, but to reach the unreachable (Matthew 28:19-20),
            and to do the impossible (Luke 1:37) to God’s glory.
