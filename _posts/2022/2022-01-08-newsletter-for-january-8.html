          <p>
            The first passage we’re looking at is not even in Genesis! It’s in Exodus 20:8-11:
          </p>
          <p>“Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy. <b>Six days</b> you shall labor, and do all your work,
            but the seventh day is a Sabbath to the Lord your God.
            On it you shall not do any work, you, or your son, or your daughter, your male servant, or your female servant,
            or your livestock, or the sojourner who is within your gates.
            For <b>in six days</b> the Lord made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that is in them,
            and rested on the seventh day. Therefore the Lord blessed the Sabbath day and made it holy.”
          </p>
          <p>
            The two times the phrase ‘six days’ appears here are parallel.
            The first occurrence, as with the rest of the Ten Commandments, is obviously literal.
            God is commanding the Israelites to work on six days of the seven-day week.
            The second occurrence is where the dispute begins. Is “day” literal, figurative, or metaphorical?
            In this case, it has to be literal because of the context, so a paraphrase would be:
            “You shall work six literal days and rest on the seventh because God created the world in six literal days and rested on the seventh.”
          </p>
          <p>
            The second passage is a snippet of Genesis 1. Verse 5 says, “God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night.
            And there was evening and there was morning, the first day.” The last sentence is repeated over and over again. It is easily overlooked.
            However, there is a meaning to it, especially in relating to the
            <a href="https://talkiocs.blogspot.com/2021/03/theistic-evolution-bible-part-1.html" style="color:dodgerblue">six-day creation</a>.
            Every time evening and morning are mentioned along with the Hebrew word for day,
            it denotes a literal, 24-hour day. In addition, every other time in the Bible an ordinal number
            (e.g. “first,” “second,” etc.) is mentioned before the Hebrew “day,” it refers to a normal, literal day.<sup style="font-size:10px">1</sup>

            There are many misconceptions about biblical creation, many of which have been implanted by mainstream worldviews and society. What I wish to do in this article is to clear up some of the confusion.

              <p><b>"Young-earth creationism"</b></p>
              <p>
                Although this is one of the names for biblical creation, it does not sum up this view of creation as a whole. The most important aspect of creationism is not the age of the earth.
                It is the correct interpretation of Genesis 1-2, the global flood, etc. Biblical creationists prefer "biblical" because their beliefs start (or should start) from the standard of the Bible,
                and thus, is a biblical perspective.

              <p><b>Genesis 1 is not literal.</b></p>
              <p>
                <a href="https://talkiocs.blogspot.com/2021/11/the-six-day-creation.html">The Hebrew text and other passages of Scripture</a> point to a six-day creation.
                Additionally, <a href="https://talkiocs.blogspot.com/2022/01/theistic-evolution.html">Genesis 1 is written as a narrative.</a> Interpretation is not a good excuse for denying Genesis 1's literality.

                Where in the Bible does this appear? Nowhere. Also, John 3:16 says that "For God so loved the world, that he gave his only Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life." (ESV)
                This well-known passage affirms that only those who believe in Jesus' redeeming act on the cross will be saved.
                There are no other requirements - we are saved by grace alone.

          <h2>Introduction</h2>
          <p class="indent">
            Evolution readily teaches 5 mass extinctions. Today we are going to talk about two creatures,
            dating back some 480 million years,<sup style="font-size:10px">1</sup> that have survived all 5 mass extinctions:
            the sea lily (<i>Crinoidea</i>) and the sea star (<i>Asteroidea</i>). This doesn’t appear to be plausible, does it?
            That’s right, it doesn't. We shall see why.
          </p>
          <h2>Ordovician-Silurian Extinction</h2>
          <p class="indent">
            The oldest mass extinction, the Ordovician-Silurian extinction, took place around 445 million years ago to 415 million years ago.
            During this period, 85% of all life supposedly died on earth. This implies that only 15% of all life during the first mass extinction survived.
            The Ordovician-Silurian extinction is said to be the second greatest mass extinction on earth.
            This extinction is suggested to be caused by toxic metals including iron, arsenic, and lead released on the earth,
            posing a threat to all marine life. This would also put sea stars and sea lilies at risk.
            Yet even according to National Geographic, evidence is lacking for the Ordovician-Silurian extinction.<sup style="font-size:10px">2</sup>
          </p>
          <h2>Devonian Extinction</h2>
          <p class="indent">
            Evolution claims that the Devonian extinction took place around 383 million years ago and lasted 20 million years.
            During this period, it is said that 75% of all life on earth, meaning only 25% of life survived.
            Somehow, both of the echinoderms, sea stars and sea lilies, are still hanging in there.
            The Devonian extinction is said to have occurred as a result of volcanic activities.
            Greenhouse gases such as sulfur dioxide could have contributed, as well as asteroid compacts.
            One compact, the Siljan crater in Sweden, is 32 miles wide.
            Occurring 377 million years ago, this crash into the earth is also credited to the Devonian extinction.
            Still, these dates and the blame of the Devonian extinction are not credible, and could be, and probably are false labels.
          </p>
          <h2>Permian-Triassic Extinction</h2>
          <p>
            Then, 252 million years ago, Evolution says the Permian-Triassic extinction took place.
            This is claimed to be the greatest mass extinction of all time. It is said that 96% of all marine life perished.
            Could sea stars and sea lilies really make that 4%? The Siberian Traps, found in Siberia, were a huge volcanic complex,
            which spewed out 720,000 cubic miles of lava.
            This eruption is assumedly credited to a large portion of the Permian-Triassic extinction.
            The seawater supposedly rose to 104 degrees Fahrenheit!
            Sea stars and sea lilies must have undergone massive adaptations to match Evolution’s expectations.
            Some features of the Permian-Triassic extinction could be slightly realistic, but the dates are complete fiction.
          </p>
          <h2>Cretaceous-Paleogene Extinction</h2>
          <p>
            The Cretaceous-Paleogene extinction is said to be the most recent mass extinction. Taking place 66 million years ago, about 76% of all life died.
            This 24% must still include the sea star and the sea lily. It is said that an asteroid seven and a half miles wide crashed into the earth,
            leaving a crater 120 miles wide in what is now the Yucatan Peninsula. Contrary to the other mass extinctions,
            global cooling actually occurred as a result of the dust from the compact.
            We do have evidence for the crater in the Yucatan Peninsula, which is now called the Chicxulub crater.
            But the compact made by the crater’s owner is exaggerated by Evolution.<sup style="font-size:10px">3</sup>
          </p>
          <h2>Out of the mist, Sea Lily and Sea Star?</h2>
          <p>
            Out of these 5 mass extinctions, we see that a great majority of life supposedly dies. Now, it’s time to get mathematical.
            In the Ordovician-Silurian extinction (445 - 415 mya), it is claimed that 85% of life died, meaning only 15% survived.
            In the Devonian extinction (383 mya), supposedly 75% of life was cleared, which means 25% remained.
            In the Permian-Triassic extinction (252 mya), it is presumed that 96% of life perished, implying that only 4% eluded extinction!
            In the Triassic-Jurassic extinction (201 mya), 80% of life is said to have fallen, telling us only 20% was spared.
            In the Cretaceous-Paleogene extinction (66 mya), 76% of all life was proposed to be eliminated by natural selection,
            which leads to 24%, which escaped death. And supposedly, both the sea star and sea lily survived all five mass extinctions!
            This is improbable. The chance of this happening for even one of these creatures escaping these mass extinctions is only 0.072%!
            Then, if we pile onto that, the fact that both sea lilies and sea stars passed through the wrath of these science-called extinctions,
            the probability is zero. Clearly, these monstrous dates and time periods are not mathematical and are incredulously unscientific.
          </p>
          <h2>The Truth & Conclusion</h2>
          <p>
            In reality, backed up by scientific evidence, there were never five mass extinctions.
            Evolution’s way of clearing the earth of its inhabitants is clearly an unscientific philosophy of deceit.
            From a Biblical perspective, it is also evident that all creation only existed for a few thousand years.
            This would include earth, the universe, and all that God made.
            Sea lilies and sea stars have always been sea lilies and sea stars since God set them on the earth. Genesis 1:24 says:
          </p>
          <p>
            “<i>And God said, “Let the earth bring forth living creatures according to their kinds—livestock
              and creeping things and beasts of the earth according to their kinds.” And it was so.</i>”<sup style="font-size:10px">4</sup>
          </p>
          <p>
            Sea stars and sea lilies are creations of God;
            they will never be anything else nor transition to anything other than the echinoderms that they are.
            God made everything good. There was no need for millions of years. No overdoses of greenhouse gases.
            No wipe-out-nearly-all-animal-kind event (except Genesis 6-8). None of the sort!
            All of these are unscientific statements added from the Evolutionary book of fiction science.
            We must “be alert and of sober-mind…”<sup style="font-size:10px">5</sup> as commanded in 1 Peter 5:8 from the deceptions of the world,
            until the day when God will once again make all things “very good.”<sup style="font-size:10px">6</sup>

              Coelacanth - Fished unextinct.
            </p>
          </div><!---->
          <p>
            The Coelacanth<sup style="font-size:10px">1</sup> (order <i>Coelacanthiformes</i>) is a fish of an extremely compelling background.
            According to Evolution, the coelacanth dwelt on the earth for over 300 million years. Because its fossils ended at what would be considered the Cretaceous period,
            it is assumed that coelacanths fell into extinction about 70 million years ago. Unforunately, ever since 1938, many coelacanths have been fished out of the oceans.
            This fact conspicuously and efficiently destroys the idea that coelacanths fell into extinction millions of years ago.
          </p>
          <p>
            Compared to their fossils, living coelacanths are virtually unchanged! The coelacanth has fins which Evolutionists aptly regarded as a transition between fins and feet.
            But because coelacanths are basically unchanged, they probably aren’t the much-needed links between land and aquatic animals, leaving Evolution on the forever-lasting wild-goose-chase for missing links.
            The coelacanth doesn’t at all back up the Evolutionary hypothesis, but rather, it points to Creation. Genesis 1 clearly and explicitly explains the creation of the universe, which includes the coelacanth.
            Everything about the coelacanth is fascinating, compelling, and reveals the work of an Intelligent, Almighty Designer.
          </p>
          <!--<p style="margin-left:40px; margin-right:40px;">
            <sup style="font-size:10px">15</sup> Behold, Behemoth,

            This would probably be a large dinosaur, perhaps Apatosaurus. In verse 17, the Behemoth’s tail is compared to a cedar tree.
            No animal living today meets that description.

          What’s the Deal With Carbon Dating?
          </h2>

          <p>
            If you have been involved in Evolution discourse at any point in time, you have probably heard the phrase ‘Carbon Dating’ thrown around a couple times.
            This article will tackle what Carbon Dating is, its reliability, and why it is so important to evolution discussions.
          </p>
          <p>
            Carbon dating is a method scientists use to predict the age of a dead organism.
            Here is how it works: When an organism is alive, it consumes carbon. Most of this carbon is carbon-12,
            which has a stable amount of neutrons. However, some carbon is an unstable isotope of carbon made from nitrogen-14
            in the upper atmosphere. This isotope is called Carbon-14. When an organism dies, it stops consuming carbon,
            and carbon-14 decays back into nitrogen-14 by emitting beta particles. Scientists measure the number of beta particles emitted and calculate,
            using the assumed rate of carbon-14’s decay, the age of the organisms.
          </p>
          <p>
            Of course, just from reading that summary many caveats and loopholes are visible.
            Carbon-14 dating doesn’t work on mussels or any other organism that hasn’t been exposed to carbon,
            because their beta radiation levels when freshly killed are at the levels of trees that have been dead for centuries.
            Radiation levels in coal, oil, and other gasses are so low, their Carbon-14 levels are also not reliable.
            However, one organism remains accurately dated by carbon dating: Trees.
            But, even some tree readings have been proven false, because the fundamental premise of carbon-14 dating is flawed.
          </p>
          <p>
            Carbon dating is predicated on the assumption that the rate of carbon decay has remained constant over the years - which is untrue.
            The amount of carbon-14 in the atmosphere fluctuates throughout the years. Fossil fuels and nuclear bomb tests also skew carbon dating results.
            As scientists study how carbon decay works, they re-evaluate carbon-dating discoveries.
            For instance, Siberia’s earliest human fossils have been shown to be at least 1,000 years younger than originally thought.
          </p>
          <p>
            The most important part of this article has to do with what carbon dating has to do with evolution.
            As many readers of this article will know, the Bible teaches that the Earth was made in six days.
            Although some Christians interpret this passage of Genesis as a metaphor and not literal teaching,
            all Christians can agree that God created each living creature intelligently and deliberately.
            The Theory of Evolution would argue otherwise. The Geological Time Scale, supported by Evolution,
            dates the earth back to 4.67 billion years ago when life first began. A few million years later,
            Archaea and protists form, and Oxygen from photosynthesis is first released into the air.
            After the Cambrian explosion, an era where scientists date the majority of invertebrate fossils,
            all the rest of living creatures evolve from these primitive, billion-year-old creatures.
          </p>
          <p>
            The problem is not that the process took billions of years, or even that carbon dating is used to extrapolate this evidence.
            The problem arises when carbon dating is used to justify the Darwinian idea that all of creation evolved from a single organism.
          </p>
          <p>
            Evolutionists explain that the Theory of Evolution does not explain the origin of life, and therefore Creationists and Evolutionists should co-exist peacefully.
            However, they simplify their own theory. The Theory of Evolution states that all organisms evolved from a single life force.
            It posits that all living creatures were created by means of natural selection, rather than intelligently by a Designer.
            The Theory of Evolution does not merely introduce the concepts of natural selection and survival of the fittest,
            it assumes that the world began from a single life force. They don’t know who created the life force,
            but they believe that it existed before anything else did, and created every living thing we know today.
          </p>
          <p>
            So what really is the problem with carbon dating? Nothing. It’s a process that dates fossils back to their origin with varying success.
            Like science, religion, and anything else, the problem arises when scientists rely on one tool when they really should try another.

          Reptiles come in all shapes and sizes. Thin, long snakes and great, bulky dinosaurs are both reptiles but are very different.
          One reptile that also comes packaged in a unique form is the Turtle. Turtles (order <i>Testudines</i>) are often found sitting on logs basking in the sun.
          They, like all reptiles, are cold-blooded, so they need external heat in order to maintain a constant body heat.
          These creatures come in a perfectly suited shell designed by an Intelligent Designer. Their shell is made of bone, and acts as a powerful shield against threats.
          Clearly, on the sixth day of creation, God made some of the most magnificent creatures on our planet.

          Incredibly, the <i>Sciuridae</i> is not just another <i>Sciuridae</i>. It is a wonderful creature fashioned by God.
          Created on the sixth day of Creation, these seemingly dull animals display in vivid ways the wonder and perfectness of
          God’s masterpieces, until they devise a master plan of how to rob the contents of your birdfeeder.

            It is always important to know what you are doing. It is also important to let others know what you are doing.
            IOCS has been doing a lot, for example, in our newsletter we feature photos, articles, and more.
            But is that the IOCS' goal? To take photos or to defeat evolution?
          </p>
          <p class="indent">
            The answer to those questions is a definite <b>no</b>. We are not here to show what we can do, what we can accomplish.
            For if we were, we could not and would not survive very long. And even if we did, our photos and articles will have no power.
            They would be empty.
          </p>
          <p class="indent">
            But our primary focus is to glorify God in all that we do. For we can do anything with God’s strength (Philippians 4:13).
            God is the one on whom we are looking to all times.
          </p>
          <p class="indent">
            This is a reminder and reaffirmation both to IOCS members and to our readers.
            We are not here to elevate ourselves or our organization, but to reach the unreachable (Matthew 28:19-20),
            and to do the impossible (Luke 1:37) to God’s glory.

          <p>
            The first passage we’re looking at is not even in Genesis! It’s in Exodus 20:8-11:
          </p>
          <p>“Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy. <b>Six days</b> you shall labor, and do all your work,
            but the seventh day is a Sabbath to the Lord your God.
            On it you shall not do any work, you, or your son, or your daughter, your male servant, or your female servant,
            or your livestock, or the sojourner who is within your gates.
            For <b>in six days</b> the Lord made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that is in them,
            and rested on the seventh day. Therefore the Lord blessed the Sabbath day and made it holy.”
          </p>
          <p>
            The two times the phrase ‘six days’ appears here are parallel.
            The first occurrence, as with the rest of the Ten Commandments, is obviously literal.
            God is commanding the Israelites to work on six days of the seven-day week.
            The second occurrence is where the dispute begins. Is “day” literal, figurative, or metaphorical?
            In this case, it has to be literal because of the context, so a paraphrase would be:
            “You shall work six literal days and rest on the seventh because God created the world in six literal days and rested on the seventh.”
          </p>
          <p>
            The second passage is a snippet of Genesis 1. Verse 5 says, “God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night.
            And there was evening and there was morning, the first day.” The last sentence is repeated over and over again. It is easily overlooked.
            However, there is a meaning to it, especially in relating to the
            <a href="https://talkiocs.blogspot.com/2021/03/theistic-evolution-bible-part-1.html" style="color:dodgerblue">six-day creation</a>.
            Every time evening and morning are mentioned along with the Hebrew word for day,
            it denotes a literal, 24-hour day. In addition, every other time in the Bible an ordinal number
            (e.g. “first,” “second,” etc.) is mentioned before the Hebrew “day,” it refers to a normal, literal day.<sup style="font-size:10px">1</sup>

            There are many misconceptions about biblical creation, many of which have been implanted by mainstream worldviews and society. What I wish to do in this article is to clear up some of the confusion.

              <p><b>"Young-earth creationism"</b></p>
              <p>
                Although this is one of the names for biblical creation, it does not sum up this view of creation as a whole. The most important aspect of creationism is not the age of the earth.
                It is the correct interpretation of Genesis 1-2, the global flood, etc. Biblical creationists prefer "biblical" because their beliefs start (or should start) from the standard of the Bible,
                and thus, is a biblical perspective.

                <a href="https://talkiocs.blogspot.com/2021/11/the-six-day-creation.html">The Hebrew text and other passages of Scripture</a> point to a six-day creation.
                Additionally, <a href="https://talkiocs.blogspot.com/2022/01/theistic-evolution.html">Genesis 1 is written as a narrative.</a> Interpretation is not a good excuse for denying Genesis 1's literality.

                Where in the Bible does this appear? Nowhere. Also, John 3:16 says that "For God so loved the world, that he gave his only Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life." (ESV)
                This well-known passage affirms that only those who believe in Jesus' redeeming act on the cross will be saved.
                There are no other requirements - we are saved by grace alone.

          <h2>Introduction</h2>
          <p class="indent">
            Evolution readily teaches 5 mass extinctions. Today we are going to talk about two creatures,
            dating back some 480 million years,<sup style="font-size:10px">1</sup> that have survived all 5 mass extinctions:
            the sea lily (<i>Crinoidea</i>) and the sea star (<i>Asteroidea</i>). This doesn’t appear to be plausible, does it?
            That’s right, it doesn't. We shall see why.
          </p>
          <h2>Ordovician-Silurian Extinction</h2>
          <p class="indent">
            The oldest mass extinction, the Ordovician-Silurian extinction, took place around 445 million years ago to 415 million years ago.
            During this period, 85% of all life supposedly died on earth. This implies that only 15% of all life during the first mass extinction survived.
            The Ordovician-Silurian extinction is said to be the second greatest mass extinction on earth.
            This extinction is suggested to be caused by toxic metals including iron, arsenic, and lead released on the earth,
            posing a threat to all marine life. This would also put sea stars and sea lilies at risk.
            Yet even according to National Geographic, evidence is lacking for the Ordovician-Silurian extinction.<sup style="font-size:10px">2</sup>
          </p>
          <h2>Devonian Extinction</h2>
          <p class="indent">
            Evolution claims that the Devonian extinction took place around 383 million years ago and lasted 20 million years.
            During this period, it is said that 75% of all life on earth, meaning only 25% of life survived.
            Somehow, both of the echinoderms, sea stars and sea lilies, are still hanging in there.
            The Devonian extinction is said to have occurred as a result of volcanic activities.
            Greenhouse gases such as sulfur dioxide could have contributed, as well as asteroid compacts.
            One compact, the Siljan crater in Sweden, is 32 miles wide.
            Occurring 377 million years ago, this crash into the earth is also credited to the Devonian extinction.
            Still, these dates and the blame of the Devonian extinction are not credible, and could be, and probably are false labels.
          </p>
          <h2>Permian-Triassic Extinction</h2>
          <p>
            Then, 252 million years ago, Evolution says the Permian-Triassic extinction took place.
            This is claimed to be the greatest mass extinction of all time. It is said that 96% of all marine life perished.
            Could sea stars and sea lilies really make that 4%? The Siberian Traps, found in Siberia, were a huge volcanic complex,
            which spewed out 720,000 cubic miles of lava.
            This eruption is assumedly credited to a large portion of the Permian-Triassic extinction.
            The seawater supposedly rose to 104 degrees Fahrenheit!
            Sea stars and sea lilies must have undergone massive adaptations to match Evolution’s expectations.
            Some features of the Permian-Triassic extinction could be slightly realistic, but the dates are complete fiction.
          </p>
          <h2>Cretaceous-Paleogene Extinction</h2>
          <p>
            The Cretaceous-Paleogene extinction is said to be the most recent mass extinction. Taking place 66 million years ago, about 76% of all life died.
            This 24% must still include the sea star and the sea lily. It is said that an asteroid seven and a half miles wide crashed into the earth,
            leaving a crater 120 miles wide in what is now the Yucatan Peninsula. Contrary to the other mass extinctions,
            global cooling actually occurred as a result of the dust from the compact.
            We do have evidence for the crater in the Yucatan Peninsula, which is now called the Chicxulub crater.
            But the compact made by the crater’s owner is exaggerated by Evolution.<sup style="font-size:10px">3</sup>
          </p>
          <h2>Out of the mist, Sea Lily and Sea Star?</h2>
          <p>
            Out of these 5 mass extinctions, we see that a great majority of life supposedly dies. Now, it’s time to get mathematical.
            In the Ordovician-Silurian extinction (445 - 415 mya), it is claimed that 85% of life died, meaning only 15% survived.
            In the Devonian extinction (383 mya), supposedly 75% of life was cleared, which means 25% remained.
            In the Permian-Triassic extinction (252 mya), it is presumed that 96% of life perished, implying that only 4% eluded extinction!
            In the Triassic-Jurassic extinction (201 mya), 80% of life is said to have fallen, telling us only 20% was spared.
            In the Cretaceous-Paleogene extinction (66 mya), 76% of all life was proposed to be eliminated by natural selection,
            which leads to 24%, which escaped death. And supposedly, both the sea star and sea lily survived all five mass extinctions!
            This is improbable. The chance of this happening for even one of these creatures escaping these mass extinctions is only 0.072%!
            Then, if we pile onto that, the fact that both sea lilies and sea stars passed through the wrath of these science-called extinctions,
            the probability is zero. Clearly, these monstrous dates and time periods are not mathematical and are incredulously unscientific.
          </p>
          <h2>The Truth & Conclusion</h2>
          <p>
            In reality, backed up by scientific evidence, there were never five mass extinctions.
            Evolution’s way of clearing the earth of its inhabitants is clearly an unscientific philosophy of deceit.
            From a Biblical perspective, it is also evident that all creation only existed for a few thousand years.
            This would include earth, the universe, and all that God made.
            Sea lilies and sea stars have always been sea lilies and sea stars since God set them on the earth. Genesis 1:24 says:
          </p>
          <p>
            “<i>And God said, “Let the earth bring forth living creatures according to their kinds—livestock
              and creeping things and beasts of the earth according to their kinds.” And it was so.</i>”<sup style="font-size:10px">4</sup>
          </p>
          <p>
            Sea stars and sea lilies are creations of God;
            they will never be anything else nor transition to anything other than the echinoderms that they are.
            God made everything good. There was no need for millions of years. No overdoses of greenhouse gases.
            No wipe-out-nearly-all-animal-kind event (except Genesis 6-8). None of the sort!
            All of these are unscientific statements added from the Evolutionary book of fiction science.
            We must “be alert and of sober-mind…”<sup style="font-size:10px">5</sup> as commanded in 1 Peter 5:8 from the deceptions of the world,
            until the day when God will once again make all things “very good.”<sup style="font-size:10px">6</sup>

              Coelacanth - Fished unextinct.
            </p>
          </div><!---->
          <p>
            The Coelacanth<sup style="font-size:10px">1</sup> (order <i>Coelacanthiformes</i>) is a fish of an extremely compelling background.
            According to Evolution, the coelacanth dwelt on the earth for over 300 million years. Because its fossils ended at what would be considered the Cretaceous period,
            it is assumed that coelacanths fell into extinction about 70 million years ago. Unforunately, ever since 1938, many coelacanths have been fished out of the oceans.
            This fact conspicuously and efficiently destroys the idea that coelacanths fell into extinction millions of years ago.
          </p>
          <p>
            Compared to their fossils, living coelacanths are virtually unchanged! The coelacanth has fins which Evolutionists aptly regarded as a transition between fins and feet.
            But because coelacanths are basically unchanged, they probably aren’t the much-needed links between land and aquatic animals, leaving Evolution on the forever-lasting wild-goose-chase for missing links.
            The coelacanth doesn’t at all back up the Evolutionary hypothesis, but rather, it points to Creation. Genesis 1 clearly and explicitly explains the creation of the universe, which includes the coelacanth.
            Everything about the coelacanth is fascinating, compelling, and reveals the work of an Intelligent, Almighty Designer.
          </p>
          <!--<p style="margin-left:40px; margin-right:40px;">
            <sup style="font-size:10px">15</sup> Behold, Behemoth,
                which I made as I made you;
                he eats grass like an ox.
                <br>
            <sup style="font-size:10px">16</sup> Behold, his strength in his loins,
                and his power in the muscles of his belly.
                <br>
            <sup style="font-size:10px">17</sup> He makes his tail stiff like a cedar;
                the sinews of his thighs are knit together.
                <br>
            <sup style="font-size:10px">18</sup> His bones are tubes of bronze,
                his limbs like bars of iron.

          <p>
            This would probably be a large dinosaur, perhaps Apatosaurus. In verse 17, the Behemoth’s tail is compared to a cedar tree.
            No animal living today meets that description.

          What’s the Deal With Carbon Dating?

          <p>
            If you have been involved in Evolution discourse at any point in time, you have probably heard the phrase ‘Carbon Dating’ thrown around a couple times.
            This article will tackle what Carbon Dating is, its reliability, and why it is so important to evolution discussions.
          </p>
          <p>
            Carbon dating is a method scientists use to predict the age of a dead organism.
            Here is how it works: When an organism is alive, it consumes carbon. Most of this carbon is carbon-12,
            which has a stable amount of neutrons. However, some carbon is an unstable isotope of carbon made from nitrogen-14
            in the upper atmosphere. This isotope is called Carbon-14. When an organism dies, it stops consuming carbon,
            and carbon-14 decays back into nitrogen-14 by emitting beta particles. Scientists measure the number of beta particles emitted and calculate,
            using the assumed rate of carbon-14’s decay, the age of the organisms.
          </p>
          <p>
            Of course, just from reading that summary many caveats and loopholes are visible.
            Carbon-14 dating doesn’t work on mussels or any other organism that hasn’t been exposed to carbon,
            because their beta radiation levels when freshly killed are at the levels of trees that have been dead for centuries.
            Radiation levels in coal, oil, and other gasses are so low, their Carbon-14 levels are also not reliable.
            However, one organism remains accurately dated by carbon dating: Trees.
            But, even some tree readings have been proven false, because the fundamental premise of carbon-14 dating is flawed.
          </p>
          <p>
            Carbon dating is predicated on the assumption that the rate of carbon decay has remained constant over the years - which is untrue.
            The amount of carbon-14 in the atmosphere fluctuates throughout the years. Fossil fuels and nuclear bomb tests also skew carbon dating results.
            As scientists study how carbon decay works, they re-evaluate carbon-dating discoveries.
            For instance, Siberia’s earliest human fossils have been shown to be at least 1,000 years younger than originally thought.
          </p>
          <p>
            The most important part of this article has to do with what carbon dating has to do with evolution.
            As many readers of this article will know, the Bible teaches that the Earth was made in six days.
            Although some Christians interpret this passage of Genesis as a metaphor and not literal teaching,
            all Christians can agree that God created each living creature intelligently and deliberately.
            The Theory of Evolution would argue otherwise. The Geological Time Scale, supported by Evolution,
            dates the earth back to 4.67 billion years ago when life first began. A few million years later,
            Archaea and protists form, and Oxygen from photosynthesis is first released into the air.
            After the Cambrian explosion, an era where scientists date the majority of invertebrate fossils,
            all the rest of living creatures evolve from these primitive, billion-year-old creatures.
          </p>
          <p>
            The problem is not that the process took billions of years, or even that carbon dating is used to extrapolate this evidence.
            The problem arises when carbon dating is used to justify the Darwinian idea that all of creation evolved from a single organism.
          </p>
          <p>
            Evolutionists explain that the Theory of Evolution does not explain the origin of life, and therefore Creationists and Evolutionists should co-exist peacefully.
            However, they simplify their own theory. The Theory of Evolution states that all organisms evolved from a single life force.
            It posits that all living creatures were created by means of natural selection, rather than intelligently by a Designer.
            The Theory of Evolution does not merely introduce the concepts of natural selection and survival of the fittest,
            it assumes that the world began from a single life force. They don’t know who created the life force,
            but they believe that it existed before anything else did, and created every living thing we know today.
          </p>
          <p>
            So what really is the problem with carbon dating? Nothing. It’s a scientific process that dates fossils back to their origin with varying success.
            Like science, religion, and anything else, the problem arises when scientists rely on one tool when they really should try another.

          Reptiles come in all shapes and sizes. Thin, long snakes and great, bulky dinosaurs are both reptiles but are very different.
          One reptile that also comes packaged in a unique form is the Turtle. Turtles (order <i>Testudines</i>) are often found sitting on logs basking in the sun.
          They, like all reptiles, are cold-blooded, so they need external heat in order to maintain a constant body heat.
          These creatures come in a perfectly suited shell designed by an Intelligent Designer. Their shell is made of bone, and acts as a powerful shield against threats.
          Clearly, on the sixth day of creation, God made some of the most magnificent creatures on our planet.

          Incredibly, the <i>Sciuridae</i> is not just another <i>Sciuridae</i>. It is a wonderful creature fashioned by God.
          Created on the sixth day of Creation, these seemingly dull animals display in vivid ways the wonder and perfectness of
          God’s masterpieces, until they devise a master plan of how to rob the contents of your birdfeeder.

            It is always important to know what you are doing. It is also important to let others know what you are doing.
            IOCS has been doing a lot, for example, in our newsletter we feature photos, articles, and more.
            But is that the IOCS' goal? To take photos or to defeat evolution?
          </p>
          <p class="indent">
            The answer to those questions is a definite <b>no</b>. We are not here to show what we can do, what we can accomplish.
            For if we were, we could not and would not survive very long. And even if we did, our photos and articles will have no power.
            They would be empty.
          </p>
          <p class="indent">
            But our primary focus is to glorify God in all that we do. For we can do anything with God’s strength (Philippians 4:13).
            God is the one on whom we are looking to all times.
          </p>
          <p class="indent">
            This is a reminder and reaffirmation both to IOCS members and to our readers.
            We are not here to elevate ourselves or our organization, but to reach the unreachable (Matthew 28:19-20),
            and to do the impossible (Luke 1:37) to God’s glory.

          <p>
            The first passage we’re looking at is not even in Genesis! It’s in Exodus 20:8-11:
          </p>
          <p>“Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy. <b>Six days</b> you shall labor, and do all your work,
            but the seventh day is a Sabbath to the Lord your God.
            On it you shall not do any work, you, or your son, or your daughter, your male servant, or your female servant,
            or your livestock, or the sojourner who is within your gates.
            For <b>in six days</b> the Lord made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that is in them,
            and rested on the seventh day. Therefore the Lord blessed the Sabbath day and made it holy.”
          </p>
          <p>
            The two times the phrase ‘six days’ appears here are parallel.
            The first occurrence, as with the rest of the Ten Commandments, is obviously literal.
            God is commanding the Israelites to work on six days of the seven-day week.
            The second occurrence is where the dispute begins. Is “day” literal, figurative, or metaphorical?
            In this case, it has to be literal because of the context, so a paraphrase would be:
            “You shall work six literal days and rest on the seventh because God created the world in six literal days and rested on the seventh.”
          </p>
          <p>
            The second passage is a snippet of Genesis 1. Verse 5 says, “God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night.
            And there was evening and there was morning, the first day.” The last sentence is repeated over and over again. It is easily overlooked.
            However, there is a meaning to it, especially in relating to the
            <a href="https://talkiocs.blogspot.com/2021/03/theistic-evolution-bible-part-1.html" style="color:dodgerblue">six-day creation</a>.
            Every time evening and morning are mentioned along with the Hebrew word for day,
            it denotes a literal, 24-hour day. In addition, every other time in the Bible an ordinal number
            (e.g. “first,” “second,” etc.) is mentioned before the Hebrew “day,” it refers to a normal, literal day.<sup style="font-size:10px">1</sup>

            There are many misconceptions about biblical creation, many of which have been implanted by mainstream worldviews and society. What I wish to do in this article is to clear up some of the confusion.

              <p><b>"Young-earth creationism"</b></p>
              <p>
                Although this is one of the names for biblical creation, it does not sum up this view of creation as a whole. The most important aspect of creationism is not the age of the earth.
                It is the correct interpretation of Genesis 1-2, the global flood, etc. Biblical creationists prefer "biblical" because their beliefs start (or should start) from the standard of the Bible,
                and thus, is a biblical perspective.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><b>Genesis 1 is not literal.</b></p>
              <p>
                <a href="https://talkiocs.blogspot.com/2021/11/the-six-day-creation.html">The Hebrew text and other passages of Scripture</a> point to a six-day creation.
                Additionally, <a href="https://talkiocs.blogspot.com/2022/01/theistic-evolution.html">Genesis 1 is written as a narrative.</a> Interpretation is not a good excuse for denying Genesis 1's literality.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><b>Evolutionists cannot be Christians</b></p>
              <p>
                Where in the Bible does this appear? Nowhere. Also, John 3:16 says that "For God so loved the world, that he gave his only Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life." (ESV)
                This well-known passage affirms that only those who believe in Jesus' redeeming act on the cross will be saved.
                There are no other requirements - we are saved by grace alone.

          <h2>Introduction</h2>
          <p class="indent">
            Evolution readily teaches 5 mass extinctions. Today we are going to talk about two creatures,
            dating back some 480 million years,<sup style="font-size:10px">1</sup> that have survived all 5 mass extinctions:
            the sea lily (<i>Crinoidea</i>) and the sea star (<i>Asteroidea</i>). This doesn’t appear to be plausible, does it?
            That’s right, it doesn't. We shall see why.
          </p>
          <h2>Ordovician-Silurian Extinction</h2>
          <p class="indent">
            The oldest mass extinction, the Ordovician-Silurian extinction, took place around 445 million years ago to 415 million years ago.
            During this period, 85% of all life supposedly died on earth. This implies that only 15% of all life during the first mass extinction survived.
            The Ordovician-Silurian extinction is said to be the second greatest mass extinction on earth.
            This extinction is suggested to be caused by toxic metals including iron, arsenic, and lead released on the earth,
            posing a threat to all marine life. This would also put sea stars and sea lilies at risk.
            Yet even according to National Geographic, evidence is lacking for the Ordovician-Silurian extinction.<sup style="font-size:10px">2</sup>
          </p>
          <h2>Devonian Extinction</h2>
          <p class="indent">
            Evolution claims that the Devonian extinction took place around 383 million years ago and lasted 20 million years.
            During this period, it is said that 75% of all life on earth, meaning only 25% of life survived.
            Somehow, both of the echinoderms, sea stars and sea lilies, are still hanging in there.
            The Devonian extinction is said to have occurred as a result of volcanic activities.
            Greenhouse gases such as sulfur dioxide could have contributed, as well as asteroid compacts.
            One compact, the Siljan crater in Sweden, is 32 miles wide.
            Occurring 377 million years ago, this crash into the earth is also credited to the Devonian extinction.
            Still, these dates and the blame of the Devonian extinction are not credible, and could be, and probably are false labels.
          </p>
          <h2>Permian-Triassic Extinction</h2>
          <p>
            Then, 252 million years ago, Evolution says the Permian-Triassic extinction took place.
            This is claimed to be the greatest mass extinction of all time. It is said that 96% of all marine life perished.
            Could sea stars and sea lilies really make that 4%? The Siberian Traps, found in Siberia, were a huge volcanic complex,
            which spewed out 720,000 cubic miles of lava.
            This eruption is assumedly credited to a large portion of the Permian-Triassic extinction.
            The seawater supposedly rose to 104 degrees Fahrenheit!
            Sea stars and sea lilies must have undergone massive adaptations to match Evolution’s expectations.
            Some features of the Permian-Triassic extinction could be slightly realistic, but the dates are complete fiction.
          </p>
          <h2>Cretaceous-Paleogene Extinction</h2>
          <p>
            The Cretaceous-Paleogene extinction is said to be the most recent mass extinction. Taking place 66 million years ago, about 76% of all life died.
            This 24% must still include the sea star and the sea lily. It is said that an asteroid seven and a half miles wide crashed into the earth,
            leaving a crater 120 miles wide in what is now the Yucatan Peninsula. Contrary to the other mass extinctions,
            global cooling actually occurred as a result of the dust from the compact.
            We do have evidence for the crater in the Yucatan Peninsula, which is now called the Chicxulub crater.
            But the compact made by the crater’s owner is exaggerated by Evolution.<sup style="font-size:10px">3</sup>
          </p>
          <h2>Out of the mist, Sea Lily and Sea Star?</h2>
          <p>
            Out of these 5 mass extinctions, we see that a great majority of life supposedly dies. Now, it’s time to get mathematical.
            In the Ordovician-Silurian extinction (445 - 415 mya), it is claimed that 85% of life died, meaning only 15% survived.
            In the Devonian extinction (383 mya), supposedly 75% of life was cleared, which means 25% remained.
            In the Permian-Triassic extinction (252 mya), it is presumed that 96% of life perished, implying that only 4% eluded extinction!
            In the Triassic-Jurassic extinction (201 mya), 80% of life is said to have fallen, telling us only 20% was spared.
            In the Cretaceous-Paleogene extinction (66 mya), 76% of all life was proposed to be eliminated by natural selection,
            which leads to 24%, which escaped death. And supposedly, both the sea star and sea lily survived all five mass extinctions!
            This is improbable. The chance of this happening for even one of these creatures escaping these mass extinctions is only 0.072%!
            Then, if we pile onto that, the fact that both sea lilies and sea stars passed through the wrath of these science-called extinctions,
            the probability is zero. Clearly, these monstrous dates and time periods are not mathematical and are incredulously unscientific.
          </p>
          <h2>The Truth & Conclusion</h2>
          <p>
            In reality, backed up by scientific evidence, there were never five mass extinctions.
            Evolution’s way of clearing the earth of its inhabitants is clearly an unscientific philosophy of deceit.
            From a Biblical perspective, it is also evident that all creation only existed for a few thousand years.
            This would include earth, the universe, and all that God made.
            Sea lilies and sea stars have always been sea lilies and sea stars since God set them on the earth. Genesis 1:24 says:
          </p>
          <p>
            “<i>And God said, “Let the earth bring forth living creatures according to their kinds—livestock
              and creeping things and beasts of the earth according to their kinds.” And it was so.</i>”<sup style="font-size:10px">4</sup>
          </p>
          <p>
            Sea stars and sea lilies are creations of God;
            they will never be anything else nor transition to anything other than the echinoderms that they are.
            God made everything good. There was no need for millions of years. No overdoses of greenhouse gases.
            No wipe-out-nearly-all-animal-kind event (except Genesis 6-8). None of the sort!
            All of these are unscientific statements added from the Evolutionary book of fiction science.
            We must “be alert and of sober-mind…”<sup style="font-size:10px">5</sup> as commanded in 1 Peter 5:8 from the deceptions of the world,
            until the day when God will once again make all things “very good.”<sup style="font-size:10px">6</sup>

              Coelacanth - Fished unextinct.
            </p>
          </div><!---->
          <p>
            The Coelacanth<sup style="font-size:10px">1</sup> (order <i>Coelacanthiformes</i>) is a fish of an extremely compelling background.
            According to Evolution, the coelacanth dwelt on the earth for over 300 million years. Because its fossils ended at what would be considered the Cretaceous period,
            it is assumed that coelacanths fell into extinction about 70 million years ago. Unforunately, ever since 1938, many coelacanths have been fished out of the oceans.
            This fact conspicuously and efficiently destroys the idea that coelacanths fell into extinction millions of years ago.
          </p>
          <p>
            Compared to their fossils, living coelacanths are virtually unchanged! The coelacanth has fins which Evolutionists aptly regarded as a transition between fins and feet.
            But because coelacanths are basically unchanged, they probably aren’t the much-needed links between land and aquatic animals, leaving Evolution on the forever-lasting wild-goose-chase for missing links.
            The coelacanth doesn’t at all back up the Evolutionary hypothesis, but rather, it points to Creation. Genesis 1 clearly and explicitly explains the creation of the universe, which includes the coelacanth.
            Everything about the coelacanth is fascinating, compelling, and reveals the work of an Intelligent, Almighty Designer.
          </p>
          <!--<p style="margin-left:40px; margin-right:40px;">
            <sup style="font-size:10px">15</sup> Behold, Behemoth,
                which I made as I made you;

            <sup style="font-size:10px">16</sup> Behold, his strength in his loins,

            This would probably be a large dinosaur, perhaps Apatosaurus. In verse 17, the Behemoth’s tail is compared to a cedar tree.
            No animal living today meets that description.

          <p>
            If you have been involved in Evolution discourse at any point in time, you have probably heard the phrase ‘Carbon Dating’ thrown around a couple times.
            This article will tackle what Carbon Dating is, its reliability, and why it is so important to evolution discussions.
          </p>
          <p>
            Carbon dating is a method scientists use to predict the age of a dead organism.
            Here is how it works: When an organism is alive, it consumes carbon. Most of this carbon is carbon-12,
            which has a stable amount of neutrons. However, some carbon is an unstable isotope of carbon made from nitrogen-14
            in the upper atmosphere. This isotope is called Carbon-14. When an organism dies, it stops consuming carbon,
            and carbon-14 decays back into nitrogen-14 by emitting beta particles. Scientists measure the number of beta particles emitted and calculate,
            using the assumed rate of carbon-14’s decay, the age of the organisms.
          </p>
          <p>
            Of course, just from reading that summary many caveats and loopholes are visible.
            Carbon-14 dating doesn’t work on mussels or any other organism that hasn’t been exposed to carbon,
            because their beta radiation levels when freshly killed are at the levels of trees that have been dead for centuries.
            Radiation levels in coal, oil, and other gasses are so low, their Carbon-14 levels are also not reliable.
            However, one organism remains accurately dated by carbon dating: Trees.
            But, even some tree readings have been proven false, because the fundamental premise of carbon-14 dating is flawed.
          </p>
          <p>
            Carbon dating is predicated on the assumption that the rate of carbon decay has remained constant over the years - which is untrue.
            The amount of carbon-14 in the atmosphere fluctuates throughout the years. Fossil fuels and nuclear bomb tests also skew carbon dating results.
            As scientists study how carbon decay works, they re-evaluate carbon-dating discoveries.
            For instance, Siberia’s earliest human fossils have been shown to be at least 1,000 years younger than originally thought.
          </p>
          <p>
            The most important part of this article has to do with what carbon dating has to do with evolution.
            As many readers of this article will know, the Bible teaches that the Earth was made in six days.
            Although some Christians interpret this passage of Genesis as a metaphor and not literal teaching,
            all Christians can agree that God created each living creature intelligently and deliberately.
            The Theory of Evolution would argue otherwise. The Geological Time Scale, supported by Evolution,
            dates the earth back to 4.67 billion years ago when life first began. A few million years later,
            Archaea and protists form, and Oxygen from photosynthesis is first released into the air.
            After the Cambrian explosion, an era where scientists date the majority of invertebrate fossils,
            all the rest of living creatures evolve from these primitive, billion-year-old creatures.
          </p>
          <p>
            The problem is not that the process took billions of years, or even that carbon dating is used to extrapolate this evidence.
            The problem arises when carbon dating is used to justify the Darwinian idea that all of creation evolved from a single organism.
          </p>
          <p>
            Evolutionists explain that the Theory of Evolution does not explain the origin of life, and therefore Creationists and Evolutionists should co-exist peacefully.
            However, they simplify their own theory. The Theory of Evolution states that all organisms evolved from a single life force.
            It posits that all living creatures were created by means of natural selection, rather than intelligently by a Designer.
            The Theory of Evolution does not merely introduce the concepts of natural selection and survival of the fittest,
            it assumes that the world began from a single life force. They don’t know who created the life force,
            but they believe that it existed before anything else did, and created every living thing we know today.
          </p>
          <p>
            So what really is the problem with carbon dating? Nothing. It’s a scientific process that dates fossils back to their origin with varying success.
            Like science, religion, and anything else, the problem arises when scientists rely on one tool when they really should try another.

          Reptiles come in all shapes and sizes. Thin, long snakes and great, bulky dinosaurs are both reptiles but are very different.
          One reptile that also comes packaged in a unique form is the Turtle. Turtles (order <i>Testudines</i>) are often found sitting on logs basking in the sun.
          They, like all reptiles, are cold-blooded, so they need external heat in order to maintain a constant body heat.
          These creatures come in a perfectly suited shell designed by an Intelligent Designer. Their shell is made of bone, and acts as a powerful shield against threats.
          Clearly, on the sixth day of creation, God made some of the most magnificent creatures on our planet.

            IOCS has been doing a lot, for example, in our newsletter we feature photos, articles, and more.
