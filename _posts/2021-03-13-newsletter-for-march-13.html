              Myth: Theistic evolution is compatible with the Bible.
            </p>
          </span>
            <p class="indent">
              What is <i>theistic evolution</i>? It is the belief that God created the world using macroevolution,
              an attempt to reconcile Christianity with evolutionism. So what is wrong with it?
            </p>
            <p class="indent">
              All we need to do is to start at the Genesis account of creation.
            </p>
            <b><p class="indent">
              1. Evolution’s sequence does not align with the Genesis account.
            </p></b>
            <p class="doubleindent">
              As many of you readers know, God created birds before he created land creatures,
              including reptiles.<sup>1,2</sup> In contrast, evolution states that dinosaurs,
              a land-dwelling reptile, evolved into birds.
            </p>
            <p class="doubleindent">
              Additionally, in Genesis, God created the earth before he created the sun, moon,
              and stars.<sup>1,3</sup> According to evolution, the sun and many stars formed before the earth.
            </p>
            <p class="doubleindent">
              These two examples show that the timelines of evolution and the Bible do not match up.
              This is only the surface of the issue.<sup>4</sup>
            </p>
            <b><p class="indent">
              2. The Hebrew context implies creation in literal days in the Genesis account.
            </p></b>
            <p class="doubleindent">
              Theistic evolution teaches that each day is figurative,
              and refers to periods of millions of years, but is this so?
            </p>
            <p class="doubleindent">
              Let’s take a look at the Hebrew word for day, <i>yom</i>.
              If <i>yom</i> occurs with an ordinal number (first, second, third, etc.) preceding it,
              it always refers to a literal, 24-hour, day.<sup>5</sup>
              It also occurs along with the phrase, “the evening and the morning.”
              Anywhere else in the Bible, this points to a 24-hour day.<sup>6</sup>
            </p>
            <p class="indent">
            Therefore, theistic evolution does not align with the biblical version of Genesis.

            <h2 class="aheading">Introduction to the Fossils</h2>
            <p class="author">
            by Ebenezer Jiang
            </p>


            <p class="indent">
              Fossils<sup>1</sup>. The origin of fossils and their formation divides Creationism from Evolutionism.
              One of them must be correct, but which one?
            </p>
            </span>
            <p class="indent">
              Evolutionists claim that fossils formed when animals or plants died, and were buried slowly, and constantly.
              They claim that this fossilization process could take hundreds, thousands, or even millions of years!
            </p>

            <p class="indent">
              But how can this be? Animals and plants that die rot,
              so for an animal to sit there for a million years will obviously be out of the question.
              Additionally, we find fossilized animals in actions that happen very quickly, such as eating, running,
              and even giving birth! Animals wouldn't just lie around in such odd positions. To press the point even further,
              plants that die wilt! But we have found plants standing fully upright! This could only mean that there must be another option…
            </p>
            <p class=indent>

            </p>
            <p class=indent>
              To all true Creationists, all animals were fashioned by the Almighty in a literal week’s timing.
              God was powerful enough that he didn’t need millions of years. Creationists believe that all fossils were made in the Flood,
              which would seal all decomposers from the organisms. In Genesis 7:11 (KJV), God tells us:
            </p>
            <i><p class=doubleindent>
              “In the six hundredth year of Noah's life, in the second month, the seventeenth day of the month,
              the same day were all the fountains of the great deep broken up, and the windows of heaven were opened.”
            </p></i>
            <p class=indent>
              In saying “the fountains of the great deep broke up”, the Bible indicates that the Flood was extremely violent and catastrophic.
              So the Flood’s turbulence would have instantaneously buried all animals in the exterior of the ark.
              This would explain why the animals and plants didn’t rot, and were fossilized doing such amazing actions.
            </p>
            <p class="indent">The origin of fossils couldn’t have been from gradual processes.
              Many obstacles, such as decomposers, scavengers, and the estimated age of fossils (to an evolutionist’s point of view),
              stand in the way of this erred theory. A more educated response would be that fossils formed during a major event,
              like the Flood.
            </p>
            <p class="indent">Anything, from fossils to all things that are around us,
              can point without error to the One who created all things, the Intelligent Designer and our Magnificent Creator.
            </p>
            <p class="indent">
            “When I consider thy heavens, the work of thy fingers, the moon and the stars, which thou hast ordained;
            What is man, that thou art mindful of him? and the son of man, that thou visitest him?” <sup>2</sup>

          </h3>

            <p class="indent">Is there any evidence in the historical record that sparks the possibility that dinosaurs coexisted with humans?
              Yes, there actually is. One such example is that of ancient figurines found in Mexico.
              In 1945, a German businessman by the name of Waldemar Julsrud was riding on his horse in
              El Toro mountain when he stumbled upon some broken pieces of ceramic buried in the dirt.
              He was familiar with many artifacts of the ancient Indian tribes in the area,
              but these looked much older. After much excavation, over 20,000 artifacts were found,
              many of which depicted people, instruments, idols, and other such things.
              But among them were hundreds of figurines that uncannily resemble dinosaurs.
              Many people believe that the figurines could not have been so old,
              because they are so accurate representations of dinosaurs.
              Since dinosaurs and man are supposedly separated by millions of years,
              most scientists believe that they are fakes.
              But this is ridiculous as more figurines like these have been found since 1945!

            <p class="indent">Another example of dinosaurs living with humans is the Ica Burial Stones.
              Javier Cabrera Darquea was given one of these stones as a paperweight for his birthday.
              Coincidentally he had seen similar oddly carved stones that his family found in their fields in the 1930s.
              In an effort to find more of them, he dug up his old fields and found over 11,000 of these stones.
              Many of these were ancient burial stones that the native Indians had placed with their dead.
              Amazingly, almost one third of these have incredibly accurate depictions of dinosaurs.
              Many of these dinosaurs were supposedly from different time periods,
              but are obviously all there.
              How would it have been possible for ancient people to carve such images if they had not seen them
              first hand or had them described by someone else? The answer is simple.
              Dinosaurs lived with humans.

          <p class="indent">
            An animal rustles in the undergrowth. Is it a shrew? A chipmunk?
            This animal is looking for food. Hmm, is it a lizard?
            It perches on a large rock so that everyone can see.
            It’s an Eastern Newt. Eastern Newts (<i>Notophthalmus viridescens</i>)<sup>1</sup> live in much of North America.
            Eastern Newts can be bright  reddish-orange or brown. Like all amphibians,
            Eastern Newts need to stay moist.
          </p>
          <span style="color:#a88f32;font-weight:bold;">
            <p>WARNING: Eastern Newts are toxic. They secrete toxin from their skin,
              the toxin has been known to be lethal to humans.
              Always thoroughly wash your hands after handling newts.<sup>1</sup></p>
          </span>
          <p class="indent">
            The most amazing factor about an Eastern Newt is that they can regenerate body pieces.
            Like geckos, these newts could regenerate tails. They could also regenerate toes, legs, and arms!
            But the most shocking thing is that they can regenerate organs (not the instrument)!<sup>1</sup>
            This means that unless they are crushed, poisoned, or lethally injured,
            Eastern Newts are good to go! Regenerating is a really complicated process.
            So it is amazing that such miniature critters have such a unique and bizzare characteristic.
            For Eastern Newts, there are no doctors required.
          </p>

          <p class="indent">
            Even newts, the small lizard-like creature, are cared for by God.
            He knows that they are fragile, so he abilitated them with regeneration.
            All this is evidence that God cares for his creation.

              “<i>When I consider thy heavens, the work of thy fingers, the moon and the stars,
                which thou hast ordained; What is man, that thou art mindful of him?
                and the son of man, that thou visitest him? ... O Lord our Lord,
                how excellent is thy name in all the earth!”</i>”<sup>2</sup>
