        The Age of the Earth

          One question that has been repeatedly asked over the centuries is “How old is the earth?”
          Many theories, ideas, and presuppositions have been struggling to achieve the title of “winner” in this race.
          The two of these are Creation and Evolution.
        </p>
        <p>
          Evolution claims that the earth is billions of years old. They use their “trusty-dusty” Radio Carbon-14 dating method to prove their point.
          In Radio Carbon-14 dating, some of the elements undergo what is called radioactive decay and then produce other elements.
          Then, Evolution measures the remaining radioactive elements and the elements that were produced to date the earth.
          Using this method, they date rocks that are “extremely old” to determine the earth’s age.<sup style="font-size:10px">1</sup>
          One zircon rock in Australia was used for testing. Evolutionists “found out” that this rock was 4.378 billion years old,
          which meant that the earth could be older.<sup style="font-size:10px">2</sup> If the earth were classified as billions of years old,
          Evolution could easily state that anything could happen over millions of years.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ok, ok. So you are using Carbon dating to determine the age of a rock?
          Unfortunately, Radio Carbon-14 dating could only be used for once living organisms or objects that have carbon-14,
          and random rocks, sadly, do not fall into this category. And this is not all, for carbon dating to work,
          we need to know how many radioactive-decaying elements and elements already processed were there to start with.
          Not to mention assuming that no interruptions disturbed the continual decaying process.
          So, when Evolutionists use carbon dating on non-carbonated, inorganic rocks, the result is often capricious.
          The result of rocks that underwent the carbon test many times could vary millions of years!
          And one thing that Evolution does is it chooses the age that best fits their time frame!
          This was the case with the Australian zircon, ZrSiO<sub style="font-size:10px">4</sub>, which contains no carbon and is inorganic.
          All of these factors all contribute to creating the incredulous age of 4 billion years.
          These woeful errors greatly discredit Evolution. Evolution is a mendacious misconception.
          To add to the encumbrance, this method of dating seems to be Evolution’s only method!
        </p>
        <p>
          Creation uses another, more reliable thing to date the earth. Using the genealogies in the Bible,
          Creationists have been able to date the earth as only about 6000 to 7000 years old.
          After all, the Bible is errorless and completely reliable.
          Not one man that has ever lived has ever found a single proof that adequately distinguishes the Bible in any way as incorrect.
          Landmarks such as canyons that dot the world, which are supposedly millions of years old, also aren’t millions of years old either.
          In the 1980s, Mt. St. Helens, a catastrophic volcano, exploded. The explosion was not only loud,
          but it also carved valleys similar to the canyons around the world in a very short amount of time.
          So it is no shocker that a flood hundreds times more powerful than Mount St. Helens could carve these landmarks in a short amount of time.
          So, it all works. Nothing in the earth is millions of years old, from the “oldest rock,”
          which might only be a few thousand years old, to the great canyons and valleys around the globe, and so,
          everything fits in the Creationist’s time frame.
        </p>
        <p>
          So, it is evident that Creation is perfect in dating the earth. In reality, the earth is only about 6000 to 7000 years old.
          Evolution is perfect in fitting what God says in 2 Peter 1:16b. Evolution is one of the many “cleverly devised myths” that many people follow.
          We need to be at all times alert and at the ready, or as the Bible puts it, “With this in mind, be alert and always keep on praying for all the Lord’s people.”
          Let us make it our goal to do just that.

          Trilobite. When many people hear this word, they immediately shrug it off as some random extinct organism,
          but the trilobite has more to offer than just an extinct critter. The word “trilobite” means “three lobes.”
          If you say it slowly, notice how much it sounds like “tri-lobe-ite.”
          (“Tri-” for triple (or three), “lobe” for lobe, and bites, because then it sounds like an organism.)<sup style="font-size:10px">2</sup>
          Most, if not everyone, who know about trilobites, confirm that they are extinct.
          (You don’t just go to the beach and find them anymore.) Well, how did they become extinct?
          This is where Evolution and Creation begin to battle. Which is right? Which is wrong?
        </p>
        <p class="indent">
          Evolution insists that these exotic crustaceans dwelt on the earth in the Paleozoic era,
          that is 250 to 570 million years ago.
          How were they fossilized? ‘Simple!’ Evolutionists would state,
          ‘Over a few million or tens of thousands of years, and over slow, constant burial.
          Eventually, the trilobite would be totally submerged in an air-proof matter and fossilization would occur.’
          See a problem with these monolithic assumptions?
        </p>
        <p class="indent">
          Trilobites are like roly-polies (check out our roly-poly article <a href="https://talkiocs.blogspot.com/2021/06/the-roly-poly.html" style="color:dodgerblue">HERE!</a>);
          they have the amazing ability to curl up into a tight ball when frightened.
          And we have observed many fossils of these marine creatures in such compacted and curled up poses.
          Now, when trilobites die, they uncurl because, similar to a <a href="https://talkiocs.blogspot.com/2021/07/bivalves-evidence-all-along.html" style="color:dodgerblue">clam</a>,
          the muscle that holds them in a ball relaxes after death. Okay, so why do we see trilobites rolled up?
          If this were the case, they would have to be alive.
          Even if Evolution says that a few “lucky ones” got buried when in this pose,
          this argument is extremely invalid because we don’t just observe a few,
          but many such specimens of curled-up trilobites!! What is the chance of that happening?
          Another obstacle is tissue.
          How can we find intact tissue in trilobite fossils that lived over 100 million years ago and were buried in a way that would kill the tissue?
          There is no reasonable explanation for how such tissue could remain for such a bizarre duration of time.
          And this is only the surface.  Many factors about the trilobite bite into Evolutionary ideas.
          Obviously, Evolution doesn’t seem to be very secure. Perhaps there is a better solution to the “trilobotic” dilemma.

        <p class="indent">
          Creationism stands with a probability that is above and beyond the zenith of the probability of Evolution’s explanation.
          Creationism teaches that the world is about 6000 to 7000 years old.
          If this is the case, trilobites would most certainly not be millions of years old.
          The Flood probably occurred 4000 to 5000 years ago. Now, the Flood would have quickly buried life.
          The catastrophism, the earth’s tectonic movement, and all of the movement and water would have instantaneously frozen creatures in place.
          Now, this could be the case with trilobites. The crustaceans, frightened from the flood’s presence,
          would instinctively roll up into a ball. This would explain why we find fossils of curled-up trilobites since the trilobites were buried alive and would not be uncurled.
          Also, the tissue would only have to last at most 5000 years. It is obvious,
          there is no more need for millions and gazillions of years.
        </p>
        <p class="indent">
          In Job 36:26, Elihu (Job’s friend) says, “Behold, God is great, and we know him not, neither can the number of his years be searched out.”
          Indeed, how true these words are! God is so great. Even the itty-bitty trilobites, which He fashioned,
          points to His great workmanship. Isn’t it amazing that our God can do what Evolution would need billions of years for,
          in less than a few thousand years? (And even less if he wanted to!) How great is our God!
          Let us magnify His name with the words from Psalm 8:1, which says,
          “O Lord, our Lord, how excellent is thy name in all the earth! who hast set thy glory above the heavens.”

          The largest land carnivore still living is the polar bear (the kodiak bear is around the same size).
          However, long ago there were creatures much larger. One of these is Andrewsarchus (“Andrew’s ruler”, named after discoverer), the largest carnivorous land mammal ever.
          Its skull alone was over 3 feet (1 meter) in length.
          At six (1.8 meters) feet tall, 12 (3.7 meters) feet long, and weighing over a ton, it dwarfed the largest of bears today.
        </p>
        <p>
          Although it was a vicious killer and unlike any living creature,
          it is actually be categorized with whales, hippos, pigs, and other artiodactyls<sup style="font-size:10px">1</sup>.
          It <i>may</i> have had hooves and a similar physique to pigs.<sup style="font-size:10px">2</sup> Although the concept of a meat-eating hippo or pig might seem strange at first,
          both of these animals consume meat if it is the only item available. Andrewsarchus was both a hunter and scavenger, prowling the plains of today’s Mongolia.

        Have you ever been hiking along a forgotten trail and come upon strange, triangular pits in the ground?

        (family <i>Myrmeleontidae</i>) larvae. Matured antlions, who live only about a month, drink nectar,
        while antlions still in the larvae stage strike terror into every insect and bug in the region. Why?...

        So what about those pits we were talking about earlier? As larvae, antlions are vulnerable to attack.
        Because of this, they dig themselves into the ground, and as a way to hunt, antlion larvae create a sloped pit.
        Unaware insects, such as scavenging ants and “dopey” beetles that accidentally wander too close,
        tumble into the sandy pit. When they try to escape, the sand or dust particles fall under its feet,
        which makes the victim appear to be going nowhere. To add to the insect's troubles,
        antlions flick dust particles at the insect to knock the insect down to the center of the hole.
        Once an opportunity arises, the antlion larvae will try to pin the insect in its powerful jaws.
        Once the insect or bug is firmly locked in those jaws, it's doomed. Some stronger insects may manage to escape a single pit,
        but the greater problem is, antlion larvae usually have pits around each other.
        An insect finding itself in one of those settlements is in a truly woeful pickle.
      </p>
      <p style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;line-height: 1.5;font-size:16px;" class="indent">
        Even though the antlion seems vulnerable and easy to attack, God provided tactics and strategy for these little critters.
        So the next time you see something in nature, don’t just classify it as “just another hole,” rather,
        classify it as one of God’s amazing designs.

          It is always important to know what you are doing. It is also important to let others know what you are doing.
          IOCS has been doing a lot, for example, in our newsletter we feature photos, articles, and more.
          But is that the IOCS' goal? To take photos or to defeat evolution?
        </p>
        <p class="indent">
          The answer to those questions is a definite <b>no</b>. We are not here to show what we can do, what we can accomplish.
          For if we were, we could not and would not survive very long. And even if we did, our photos and articles will have no power.
          They would be empty.
        </p>
        <p class="indent">
          But our primary focus is to glorify God in all that we do. For we can do anything with God’s strength (Philippians 4:13).
          God is the one on whom we are looking to all times.
        </p>
        <p class="indent">
          This is a reminder and reaffirmation both to IOCS members and to our readers.
          We are not here to elevate ourselves or our organization, but to reach the unreachable (Matthew 28:19-20),
          and to do the impossible (Luke 1:37) to God’s glory.
