            Inconsistent? You ask.
          </p>
          <p style="" class="indent">
            Yes. Here‚Äôs why:
          </p>
          <p style="" class="indent">
            <b>Evolution claims to be scientific, but it breaks scientific laws.</b>
            The Law of Biogenesis (bƒ´‚Äô‚Ä¢≈ç‚Ä¢je‚Ä¢n…ô‚Ä¢s…ôs) says that life can only come from life.
            Clearly, evolution contradicts that when it says that life evolved from lifeless molecules.
            Also, the First Law of Thermodynamics (th…ôr‚Ä¢m≈ç‚Ä¢dƒ´‚Ä¢na‚Äô‚Ä¢miks) states that ‚Äúenergy cannot be created or destroyed.‚Äù
            How about during the Big Bang? Where did that first energy originate?
          <p style="" class="indent">
            <b>Evolution is not based on scientific, historical, or logical fact.</b>
            People may gain absolute knowledge in many ways.
            Through science, you may utilize direct observation or experimentation.
            OK, let‚Äôs see if evolution can be proven with direct observation.
            First, we need a span of millions (or at least tens of thousands) of years.
            Now we need a person or a chain of people who lived throughout that entire span.
            They each need to observe the natural world and evolution. Easy, isn‚Äôt it? No.
            Experimentation itself is closely tied with observation.
            The data gained from experiments is obtained through observation.
            So if observation cannot prove evolution, then experimentation can't either.
            Historical fact depends on first-account witnesses, or those who wrote down the first-account testimonies.
            No person ever recorded evolution.
            Logical fact depends on mathematical or logical deduction.
            Obviously, this has no application in terms of evolution.
            Therefore, evolution is not founded on fact.
          </p>
          <p style="" class="doubleindent">
            Evolution is based on orderly, predictable processes.
            C-14 (Radiocarbon) dating measures the decay of rock, starting at the presupposition that the decay rate stayed constant.
            Erosion supposedly occurred at a steady pace. However, take a look at the Cambrian Explosion,
            when a great number of animals ‚Äúappeared‚Äù in the fossil record. This is extremely sudden.
            In addition to the explosion, there are also many explosive extinctions. In fact,
            evolution says that there have been 5 major mass extinctions!<sup style="font-size:10px;">1</sup> Also, if evolution was true,
            then we would see at least a few hundred mutations with a gain of information. In contrast, we see none.
            Some evolutionists claim that this happens since evolution is unpredictable. It happened quickly back then.
            Now it‚Äôs ‚Äúinvisible.‚Äù Note the irony.
            <b>Evolutionists use dating that employs constant time to prove a mechanism that is inconstant and sudden.</b>
          </p>
          <p>
            Creationists, however, are neither inconsistent nor uncertain.
            Moses recorded God's first account of creation.
            <b>Creationists also have one foundation that they hold on to in everything:
            the Bible, which is full of consistent truths.</b>

            Wood is used for many things. Most houses, fences, tables, chairs, and shelves are all made of wood.
            In fact, 7% of the surface of the earth is trees (that‚Äôs over 1 million square miles!)! Unsurprisingly,
            since the earth is covered with trees, we also find many fossils of trees, which we call ‚Äúpetrified wood,‚Äù
            which appears to be wood, but is really rock.
          </p>
          <p style="" class="indent">
            According to evolution, trees began to peek from the earth 400 million years ago.
            They claim that the petrified wood forms when trees fall and are buried with sediments,
            such as mud and volcanic ash, and after a few million years, the trees would become petrified wood.
          </p>
          <p style="" class="indent">
            This is invalid. We have observed real specimens of petrified wood that still have splinters on them!
            This could only form by a quick, rapid, air-tight burial. Otherwise,
            splinters would be weathered away by constant erosion (consider driftwood).
          </p>
          <p style="" class="indent">
            Then, there is also the entire bacteria and decomposition problem.
          </p>
          <p style="" class="indent">
            Additionally, we see petrified tree fossils that stand in many layers of rock,
            which evolutionists claim to have formed over millions and billions of years. Right. So,
            how could a tree stand up for millions of years again? The oldest tree that is still standing is
            younger than 10,000 years old. 10,000 years only 1% of a million years.
            So how can a tree stand up for a million years,
            much less the <i>millions of years</i> that it would take for a single layer of rock to be laid!
          </p>
          <p style="" class="indent">
            Not to mention the fact that trees that have fallen and lie around usually make an extraordinarily lovely home for bugs and worms.
            In petrified wood, we don‚Äôt often find bugs.
            This means that fresh trees were fossilized and that some trees were not lying around for millions of years.
          </p>
          <p style="" class="indent">
            All of this evolutionary talk is in reality human ideas and thought and not true science.
          </p>
          <p style="" class="indent">
            According to Creation, all trees were buried by a global, catastrophic flood.
            This makes sense because then layers of sediment could be laid down very rapidly.
            Fortunately for trees, petrified wood no longer has to stand for a million years.
            Also, the flood occurred about 6000 years ago,
            and if the flood destroyed all the trees that had begun to grow before the flood,
            then it would make sense if the oldest living tree is 5000 years old,
            which should have sprouted soon after the flood.
          </p>
          <p style="" class="indent">
            Even trees, simple though they seem, the things that we see every day, can display the perfectness of God, and the extreme error of evolution.

            The column, "Dinosaurs of Eden," is a bi-weekly article. Last week's article:
          </p>
          <p style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;line-height: 1.5;font-size:16px;" class="indent">
            Something to consider is chapter 40 of Job, in the Bible. God describes a creature that matches the physical attributes of some species of dinosaurs.
            While God is talking to Job, God asks him if he had seen the ‚Äúbehemoth.‚Äù God describes the animal by saying:
          </p>
          <i><p style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;line-height: 1.5;font-size:16px;" class="indent">
            ‚ÄúBehold now behemoth, which I made with thee; he eateth grass as an ox. Lo now, his strength is in his loins,
            and his force is in the navel of his belly. He moveth his tail like a cedar: the sinews of his stones are wrapped together.
            His bones are as strong pieces of brass; his bones are like bars of iron. He is the chief of the ways of God:
            he that made him can make his sword to approach unto him.‚Äù<sup style="font-size:10px;">1</sup>
          </p></i>
          <p style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;line-height: 1.5;font-size:16px;" class="indent">
            Certainly, no animal with the likes of these walks the earth today.
            Many dinosaurs definitely had ‚Äútails like cedar trees,‚Äù and ‚Äúbones like beams of brass.‚Äù
            Some people would argue that the creature described by God could be a hippopotamus or an elephant,
            but these creatures undoubtedly do not have ‚Äútails like cedar trees.‚Äù Hippopotamus and elephants and have tiny stubby tails.
            And although the elephant would seem to be ‚Äúthe first of the works of God,‚Äù because of its immense weight of about 14,000 pounds,
            it is dwarfed by the titanic sauropods, weighing in at about 150,000 pounds. The truth is,
            there is no animal that has ever walked the earth that is more fitting to this description than a dinosaur.
          </p>
          <p style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;line-height: 1.5;font-size:16px;" class="indent">
            In the book of Job, we can also read of another creature that sounds very similar to a dinosaur-like, water-living reptile.
            God calls this creature ‚ÄúLeviathan.‚Äù He describes the animal to Job in chapter 41:
          </p>
          <p style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;line-height: 1.5;font-size:16px;" class="indent">
            <i>By his neesings [sneezings] a light doth shine, and his eyes are like the eyelids of the morning. Out of his mouth go burning lamps,
              and sparks of fire leap out. Out of his nostrils goeth smoke, as out of a seething pot or caldron.
              His breath kindleth coals, and a flame goeth out of his mouth.<sup style="font-size:10px;">2</sup>
            </i>
          </p>
          <p style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;line-height: 1.5;font-size:16px;" class="indent">
            <i>Sharp stones are under him: he spreadeth sharp pointed things upon the mire. He maketh the deep to boil like a pot:
              he maketh the sea like a pot of ointment. He maketh a path to shine after him; one would think the deep to be hoary.
              Upon earth there is not his like, who is made without fear.<sup style="font-size:10px;">3</sup>
            </i>
          </p>
          <p style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;line-height: 1.5;font-size:16px;" class="indent">
            What is this incredible creature God described in his conversation with Job? It is certainly like no other creature alive today.
            Some people believe that this creature could be a crocodile or a whale. But whales do not have
            ‚Äúsharp stones" on their underside, and crocodiles do not have ‚Äúburning lamps" that come from their mouths.
            This animal was a sea monster that lived not millions of years ago, but thousands of years ago when Job lived.
            It was probably a mosasaur or pliosaur, gigantic, oceanic, a reptilian predator that apparently breathed fire.
            Many people think that this creature is imaginary, but God talks about it along with other animals like the behemoth,
            the wild donkey, the ox, mountain goats, horses, lions, and hawks.
            The leviathan and behemoth were just another part of God‚Äôs glorious creation just like the other beasts of the land, sea, and air.

          Right, but Tufted Titmice do. The Tufted Titmouse<sup style="font-size:10px">1</sup> (<i>Baeolophus bicolor</i>) is a small sparrow-sized bird that lives in the United States.
          Titmice have a gray back, a little splotch of orange under their wing, and a soft, white belly.
          These birds eat seeds, bugs, and other such items. Sometimes, the titmouse will hang upside down, hover,
          or dive to snack on a yummy chunk of food.

          Although many factors about these birds are utterly amazing,
          one outstanding fact shows the incredible design and skill this bird received.
          Tufted Titmice love snacking on seeds, in particular, sunflower seeds. Unfortunately for many animals,
          the sunflower seeds have a hard shell, but this is no problem for the tufted titmouse.
          The intelligent birds hold the seed still between their feet. Then, they use their black beak to peck it open.
          This method is highly successful, and it works, not only for the sunflower
          but also for acorns and other kinds of seeds. But that‚Äôs not all! Can‚Äôt eat anymore? No problem for this little genius.
          Titmice will actually store up food. This is really useful, since a source of food isn‚Äôt always there,
          even in the case of a birdfeeder (the owner may forget to refill, there may be enemies, etc.).
          All of this seems, for some reason, intelligently designed.
        </p>
        <p style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;line-height: 1.5;font-size:16px;" class="indent">
          As always, tufted titmice are a gift of God. They display his wonderful creation, the beauty and purposefulness of his work, and his power. In Matthew 10:28-31, God tells us:
        </p>
        <p style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;line-height: 1.5;font-size:16px;" class="indent">
          <i>‚ÄúAre not two sparrows sold for a farthing? and one of them shall not fall on the ground without your Father. But the very hairs of your head are all numbered. Fear ye not therefore, ye are of more value than many sparrows.‚Äù</i>
        </p>
        <p style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;line-height: 1.5;font-size:16px;" class="indent">
          God cares for every one of his creations, but he cares even more about us. What a great, amazing promise God gave to us, and what a great glimpse of the love and of the care of our Creator God.
