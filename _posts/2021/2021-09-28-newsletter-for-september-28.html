          It is beyond a doubt that fossils are incredibly amazing. Have you ever wondered how we got all the fossils that we see today?
        </p>
        <p>
          According to the Evolutionary worldview, fossils formed by slow burial over millions of years.
          They need these millions of years because, without the fossils being so old,
          Evolution doesn’t have the time to evolve.
          Evolution claims that animals are constantly undergoing macroevolution
          (that is, evolution from animal kind to animal kind).
          So, the animals we see today would be quite different from the animals in fossils.
        </p>
        <p>
          But this doesn’t seem to be the case.
          Taphonomists (scientists who study the forming of fossils) have discovered that fossils,
          in the right conditions, could fossilize at the astonishing rate of a few days or even hours.
          But if an animal was left to fossilize over millions of years, it would decay at the astounding rate of a few days,
          or maybe even hours! One fish, the coelacanth was thought to be extinct and its fossils were classified as 400 million years old.
          This fish has uniquely shaped fins that were assumed to be fins evolving into feet and were aptly tagged as a missing link between fish and amphibians.
          But, in 1938, a living coelacanth that was fished up out of the Indian Ocean had the same features as the coelacanth in the fossil specimens!
          Its fins turned out to be no example of fin-to-foot evolution but an Intelligently Designed feature that helps the coelacanth swim vertically.
          According to Evolution’s macroevolution theory, an animal remaining without changing over 400 million years is incredulous.
          But that’s not all! Intact cells, tissues, proteins, pigments, and DNA discovered in fossils also clearly refute the idea of fossilization over millions of years.
          It all simply means that there were no millions of years, no missing links, and no macroevolution.
          (Also check out our article on <a href="https://talkiocs.blogspot.com/2021/09/living-fossils.html" style="color:dodgerblue">Living Fossils</a>.)
        </p>
        <p>
          According to the Creationist’s worldview, fossils were formed by a simple event mentioned in Genesis 6 through 8.
          The Bible tells us that the Flood was catastrophic (see Genesis 7:11).
          The conditions of the Flood, such as the catastrophic activity,
          would have instantaneously buried animals stranded outside of the ark in a muck of sediment.
          The buried animals would then fossilize. And that’s how we have the fossils we see today: the Flood.
        </p>
        <p>
          Fossils completely deny that theory of Evolution. No missing links, no macroevolution, no millions of years!
          Without fossils to back up the theory of macroevolution, Evolution is stuck in the muck.
          From the massive, fossilized skeleton of the sauropods to the tiny exoskeleton of a trilobite,
          fossils are simply evidence of the work of an Intelligent Designer.

          Crinoids. Crinoids. Crinoids? It is true that the term “crinoid” sounds foreign, mythical, perhaps, or maybe even alien.
          And because of this, most people probably consider crinoids as some extinct organism.
          But is this presupposition correct? Well, what are crinoids? Crinoids refer to any organism under the class <i>Crinoidea</i>.<sup style="font-size:10px">1</sup>
          Most crinoids are like sea anemones. Often what we see in a fossil is a stem with long feathery arms protruding from the center of the stem,
          and there are many more variations. So crinoids are fossils. It is true that crinoids are one of the most commonly found fossils,<sup style="font-size:10px">2</sup>
          but believe it or not, there are actual crinoids alive today! Over 700 species of crinoids are known to be alive, and maybe more!
          Yet even with 700 alive, many hundreds, or even thousands, are no longer living creatures, but rocky fossils.
          How did this happen? This is where Creation and Evolution combat.
        </p>
        <p class="indent">
          Evolution dictates that from the Cambrian to the Mesozoic era (over 550 million years ago) crinoids dominated the ocean floor.
          In the Evolutionist’s eye at the end of the Permian Period, at about 252 million years ago,
          there was a mass extinction and most of the crinoids were wiped out.
          They think that a crinoid’s fossil is buried slowly and that there were a few bits and pieces of rapid burial,
          but that rapid burial was overall scarce. Some, they say, did survive and evolved into the sea lilies we see today.
        </p>
        <p class="indent">
          Alright, pretty scientific huh? No. You know, 500 million is a long time. How did you know the earth was millions of years old?
          Ironically, there is no real evidence to support the age of the earth being billions or even millions of years old.
          Additionally, crinoids are extremely fragile. Within a few days of its death, a crinoid’s soft, feathery arms would have completely decayed.
          If a crinoid was buried slowly as Evolution suggests, no complete crinoid specimen would be fossilized at all.<sup style="font-size:10px">3</sup>
          So, how then is it that we find complete fossil specimens? To increase Evolution’s woes, some crinoid fossils have pigment!
          No pigment could have been preserved if the crinoid was buried too high (water and erosion factors would damage the pigment)
          or too low (tectonic movement would destroy the pigment). The crinoid would have to be buried just right,
          and for that to be achieved, a great amount of chance would be required and a rapid burial would have to be undergone
          (if it were slow burial, all the pigment would be erased).<sup style="font-size:10px">4</sup> Evolutionists may suggest that there was some rapid burial.
          But if you believe in rapid burial, why don’t you believe in a worldwide flood?
        </p>
        <p>
          Creationism gives us a much clearer and more reliable answer. On the third day of creation, God made all marine life, which includes crinoids.
          The Flood would have easily and quickly buried crinoids, and by doing so left no opportunity for bacterial decay, which would eventually fossilize.
          Also, it may be that the catastrophic climate of the flood in some places could have been so violent
          that the crinoids lost their softer body parts and the hard, stem-like remains would continue to fossilize.
          Yet pigment could be preserved because of the rapid burial. You see, through man’s perspective, millions of years does the trick.
          But in reality, in only a few thousand years did God create the world, the fossils, and the wonderful crinoid.
          What more can you ask for? What a magnificent, awesome, almighty God we serve.

          <i>Mosasaurus</i> (Meuse lizard) is the closest creature to a real -life sea monster.
          It was a gigantic oceanic predator. Do not worry, these magnificent beasts are now extinct,
          due to unknown reasons. Mosasaurus was one of the largest of its kind,
          growing to nearly 60 feet in length and weighing around 15 tons.
        </p>
        <p>
          Interestingly, Mosasaurus fits the description of a creature mentioned in the Bible. In Job we read:
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>Who can open the doors of his face? his teeth are terrible round about.
            His scales are his pride, shut up together as with a close seal.
            One is so near to another, that no air can come between them.
            They are joined one to another, they stick together, that they cannot be sundered.
            By his neesings a light doth shine, and his eyes are like the eyelids of the morning.
            Out of his mouth go burning lamps, and sparks of fire leap out.
            Out of his nostrils goeth smoke, as out of a seething pot or caldron.
            His breath kindleth coals, and a flame goeth out of his mouth.</i>
            <br>
            <span style="text-align:right;">(Job 41:14-21)</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          And also:
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>He maketh the deep to boil like a pot: he maketh the sea like a pot of ointment.
            He maketh a path to shine after him; one would think the deep to be hoary.
            Upon earth there is not his like, who is made without fear.</i>
            <br>
            <span style="text-align:right;">(Job 41:31-33)</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          This creature is called Leviathan, and it seems to be a large, sea reptile.
          In this description, it also states that Leviathan could breathe fire.
          Did Mosasaurus breathe fire? Although we have no idea what this creature is,
          no animal on earth fits this description more than Mosasaurus.

        Echo Chambers and Strengthening Your Argument
        </h2>
        <p style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;line-height: 1.5;font-size:14px;text-align:center;font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;" class="author">
        by Ellie Strano
        </p>
        <span style="margin-left:80px;margin-right:80px;">
        <span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;line-height: 1.5;font-size:16px;" class="indent">
        <p>
          An Echo Chamber is defined by Oxford Dictionary as
          “an environment in which a person encounters only beliefs or opinions that coincide with their own
          so that their existing views are reinforced and alternative ideas are not considered.”
          In other words, when someone surrounds themselves with ideas that only reflect their personal, already formed belief,
          they are living in an Echo Chamber. Think of a person shouting their idea into a cave,
          only to have it echo back without challenging or changing it.
          An Echo Chamber is a psychological bias that prevents one from thinking critically.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let’s look at another example of a psychological bias: a Confirmation bias.
          A confirmation bias happens when you seek out information that agrees with a belief you have,
          instead of looking at all objective information on the subject. As an example, let’s say Tony believes in astrology.
        </p>
        <p>
          Tony’s zodiac tells him he will find five dollars on the ground that day. Later that morning, he finds money on the ground.
          Tony excitedly rants to everyone he knows that his experience is irrefutable evidence of astrology.
          He doesn’t remember the dozens of times when he found money but his zodiac didn’t say he would,
          or when he didn’t find money even though the zodiac reassured him he would.
          Tony already believed in astrology before he found money on the ground, so he seeks out examples that support his belief,
          forgetting or ignoring contrary facts.
        </p>
        <p>
          It’s doubtful that any reader of this newsletter has such an extreme confirmation bias like Tony’s.
          However, no one is immune to these psychological traps like echo chambers and biases.
        </p>
        <p>
          This newsletter column is about defending your argument. It will help you recognize flaws in an evolutionist’s arguments,
          and how to carefully construct a counter-argument. While you learn, it’s important to remember that sometimes the answer lies somewhere in the middle.
          Not everything is black and white, or left and right.
          Excluding some ideas because you <i>assume</i> you already know the argument
          instead of taking the time to understand it is tribal thinking,
          another psychological bias that will keep you from truly understanding God’s creation.
        </p>
        <p>
          So how does one avoid an Echo Chamber or another psychological bias,
          especially in an age when everyone is only a few clicks away from hearing whatever opinion that will confirm their bias?
          The answer is: by talking to people and engaging with ideas that differ from yours.
          Keeping your sources diverse, from all different backgrounds and schools of thought, maintains a healthy, well-tested argument,
          one that can stand its ground against any refutation.
          It is important to understand the opposing viewpoint, not only because you will avoid an echo chamber,
          but also because when you fully understand a worldview, you will understand how it is flawed.

      <p>
        You are hiking in a sunny, flowery meadow looking for exotic creatures.
        You just passed one, which you supposed to be just a stick.
        The praying mantis, (<i>Mantodea</i>)<sup style="font-size:10px">1,2</sup> is a master of disguise.
        Despite the fact that praying mantis can grow up to 5 inches in length,
        they are so well-camouflaged that most predators or potential predators miss them!
        Surprisingly, some mantids are found in fossils, which must mean quick burial.<sup style="font-size:10px">3</sup>
      </p>
      <p>
        The most eye-catching feature of the praying mantis is its front legs.
        Mantids have an incredible, Intelligent(-ly Designed), and effective way of hunting.
        The front legs of a praying mantis have sharp, hooked spikes.
        These are folded when not in use, and so suggest a praying position.
        (Again, showing evidence of an Intelligent Designer)
        These hooks are not harmful to humans, but to an oblivious insect or arachnid, it’s lethal.
        Once a praying mantis lines up with its unsuspecting target, the job is done in seconds,
        or to be more specific, milliseconds. It takes only 50-70 milliseconds<sup style="font-size:10px">4</sup> for a praying mantis
        to strike and pull back its struggling victim. Now, that’s some speed.
        50 milliseconds is 0.5 seconds, which is almost as fast as the blink of an eye!
        (Interested in reading about
        <a href="https://talkiocs.blogspot.com/2021/02/unsimplified-jellyfish.html" style="color:dodgerblue">another creature with super-speeds?</a>)
        Once the target has been clamped tightly in the claws, the mantis can then slowly devour the insect trapped in its claws.
        Because mantids are so large, and this method is so effective,
        some mantid species can hunt frogs, lizards, or even mice! Now that’s an Intelligently-Designed feature!

      <p>
        Each one of the 2300 species of mantids is obviously richly equipped with a superpower
        that can only be granted by God, the Intelligent Designer.
        Even though something may seem to look like “just like a stick,” look closer.
        You may find something beyond comprehension.

          I maintain that all the evil influences that I can trace have been internal and not external,
          you know what I mean—that I have the capacity of being more wicked than any example that man could set me,
          and that if I escape, it is only by God's grace helping me to get rid of myself, partially in science, more completely in society,
          — but not perfectly except by committing myself to God as the instrument of His will,

          It is always important to know what you are doing. It is also important to let others know what you are doing.
          IOCS has been doing a lot, for example, in our newsletter we feature photos, articles, and more.
          But is that the IOCS' goal? To take photos or to defeat evolution?
        </p>
        <p class="indent">
          The answer to those questions is a definite <b>no</b>. We are not here to show what we can do, what we can accomplish.
          For if we were, we could not and would not survive very long. And even if we did, our photos and articles will have no power.
          They would be empty.
        </p>
        <p class="indent">
          But our primary focus is to glorify God in all that we do. For we can do anything with God’s strength (Philippians 4:13).
          God is the one on whom we are looking to all times.
        </p>
        <p class="indent">
          This is a reminder and reaffirmation both to IOCS members and to our readers.
          We are not here to elevate ourselves or our organization, but to reach the unreachable (Matthew 28:19-20),
          and to do the impossible (Luke 1:37) to God’s glory.
