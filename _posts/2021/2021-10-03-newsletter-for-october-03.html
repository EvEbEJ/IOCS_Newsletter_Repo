          Little is known concerning the deep sea and its creatures. Many creatures that lurk in the depths of the ocean are exotic, bizarre, and extraordinary.
          One of the most amazing deep-sea-dwellers is the coelacanth. The Coelacanth<sup style="font-size:10px">1,2,3,4</sup> (order <i>Coelacanthiformes</i>) is a fish of an extremely compelling background.
          Not only is it exotic in looks and features, but it is also a battleground between two worldviews — Creation and Evolution.
        </p>
        <p>
          According to Evolution, the coelacanth dwelt on the earth for over 300 million years. Because its fossils ended at what would be considered the Cretaceous period,
          it is assumed that coelacanths fell into extinction about 70 million years ago. The coelacanth has fins which Evolutionists aptly regarded as a transition between fins and feet.
          So, the coelacanth is backing up Evolution, right?
        </p>
        <p>
          No. It actually isn’t. Ever since 1938, many coelacanths have been fished out of the oceans.
          This fact conspicuously and efficiently destroys the idea that coelacanths fell into extinction millions of years ago.
          Additional research was done on the coelacanth; the results were astonishing. Compared to their fossils, living coelacanths are virtually unchanged!
          This is a nuisance to Evolution in many ways. First of all, any species living for hundreds of millions of years should have evolved!
          Then there’s the fact that since coelacanths are unchanged, they probably aren’t the much-needed links between land and aquatic animals,
          leaving Evolution on the forever-lasting wild-goose-chase for missing links. Also, if Evolution’s presupposition of burial and gradual processes was correct,
          we shouldn’t see any fish fossils! Another question is since the coelacanth is still alive and did not fall into extinction,
          why did its fossils “end” in the fossil record at the Cretaceous period? It’s all very simple.
          There was simply no Cretaceous period (and any other period found in Evolution’s sound-like-science library for that matter<sup style="font-size:10px">5</sup>),
          no millions of years, no missing links, and evidently no Evolution.
        </p>
        <p>
          Evolution is easily disregarded when considering the coelacanth. The coelacanth doesn’t at all back up the Evolutionary hypothesis, but rather, it points to Creation.
          Genesis 1 clearly and explicitly explains the creation of the universe, which includes the coelacanth. Fossils were most likely created in an event, which took place in Genesis 6 through 8.
          Through rapid burial and the right conditions provided by the Flood, the coelacanth has become not only an awe-striking fossil but an ever-present reminder of how God acts towards sinfulness.
          Everything about the coelacanth is fascinating, compelling, and revealing the work of an Intelligent, Almighty Designer.

          If you went to the beach, what is the first thing you think you will see? It may be seagulls, perhaps a crab or two, and maybe some fish.
          Well, one marine creature that was abundant before the great flood was the notable ammonite. Ammonites have a shell similar to that of a snail which spirals away.
          Like the orthocera (Check out our orthocera article <a href="https://talkiocs.blogspot.com/2021/06/the-orthocera.html">HERE</a>!),
          these shells were the hospitable home of a unique cephalopod (Cephalopods include octopi and squid and a generous assortment of other similar animals).
          These magnificent marine creatures varied in size; they could be one inch or nine feet long! Ammonites, who at first abundantly dotted the ocean,
          now abundantly dot rocky slabs of fossils. How’d these fossils form? You know, I’d really like to know!
        </p>
        <p class="indent">
          “Oh, simple.” A secular scientist would tell you. “Starting from the Jurassic period, ammonites have roamed the earth for 130 million years.
          At the end of the Cretaceous, that is 66 million years ago, they eventually became extinct.”<sup style="font-size:10px">1</sup>
        </p>
        <p class="indent">
          Millions of years? I don’t know about that. It is evident through the genealogies in the Bible that the earth is probably only about 6000 years old.
          (You may find yourself going in circles if you try to refute the Bible.) Also, when we look up the fossil record,
          it’s surprising what we find (if we look through “Evolution’s glasses”). Throughout this so-assumed “130 million years,”
          we find no major evolution going on, even though in 130 million years, they should get more complicated.
          All we find is more elaborate shell patterns on what are called “evolved” ammonites.<sup style="font-size:10px">2</sup> In fossil-embedded sheets of clay that are up to 100 feet tall,
          how is it that we have not the faintest glimpse of ammonites evolving? After all, these 100 feet are millions of years of bit-by-bit fossilization according to the secularist.
          It’s all clear and explicit. There were no millions of years and no macroevolution in ammonites (and anything else for that matter), and that topples the Evolutionary theory.
        </p>
        <p>
          The answers are simple for the Creationist. About 4000 to 5000 years ago, a worldwide flood engulfed the earth.
          High levels of catastrophic movement in the earth would have caused great turbulence and sediment erosion, which could have quickly buried the ammonites.
          These buried ammonites would have become the beautiful and elaborate fossils that we view on display today. Also, interestingly, a study was done on the Chambered Nautilus,
          which are similar to ammonites. Scientists discovered that these mollusks take a long time to mature enough to breed and reproduce. If this was also so with the ammonite,
          and the maturing time period was longer than the Chambered Nautilus, floodwaters could have decimated the ammonite population, and brought them down to extinction.
          Ammonites truly display God’s splendor and the truthfulness of His word. These fabulously designed creatures show not only Intelligent Design but also show the error of Evolution.
          So the next time you go on a walk, or go perhaps to the beach, remember that every creature that you come across is specially designed by God, and praise Him for it.
          Who knows? That creature may hold a secret waiting to be unlocked.

          <i>Mosasaurus</i> (Meuse lizard) is the closest creature to a real -life sea monster.
          It was a gigantic oceanic predator. Do not worry, these magnificent beasts are now extinct,
          due to unknown reasons. Mosasaurus was one of the largest of its kind,
          growing to nearly 60 feet in length and weighing around 15 tons.
        </p>
        <p>
          Interestingly, Mosasaurus fits the description of a creature mentioned in the Bible. In Job we read:
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>Who can open the doors of his face? his teeth are terrible round about.
            His scales are his pride, shut up together as with a close seal.
            One is so near to another, that no air can come between them.
            They are joined one to another, they stick together, that they cannot be sundered.
            By his neesings a light doth shine, and his eyes are like the eyelids of the morning.
            Out of his mouth go burning lamps, and sparks of fire leap out.
            Out of his nostrils goeth smoke, as out of a seething pot or caldron.
            His breath kindleth coals, and a flame goeth out of his mouth.</i>
            <br>
            <span style="text-align:right;">(Job 41:14-21)</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          And also:
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>He maketh the deep to boil like a pot: he maketh the sea like a pot of ointment.
            He maketh a path to shine after him; one would think the deep to be hoary.
            Upon earth there is not his like, who is made without fear.</i>
            <br>
            <span style="text-align:right;">(Job 41:31-33)</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          This creature is called Leviathan, and it seems to be a large, sea reptile.
          In this description, it also states that Leviathan could breathe fire.
          Did Mosasaurus breathe fire? Although we have no idea what this creature is,
          no animal on earth fits this description more than Mosasaurus.

        Echo Chambers and Strengthening Your Argument
        </h2>
        <p style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;line-height: 1.5;font-size:14px;text-align:center;font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;" class="author">
        by Ellie Strano
        </p>
        <span style="margin-left:80px;margin-right:80px;">
        <span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;line-height: 1.5;font-size:16px;" class="indent">
        <p>
          An Echo Chamber is defined by Oxford Dictionary as
          “an environment in which a person encounters only beliefs or opinions that coincide with their own
          so that their existing views are reinforced and alternative ideas are not considered.”
          In other words, when someone surrounds themselves with ideas that only reflect their personal, already formed belief,
          they are living in an Echo Chamber. Think of a person shouting their idea into a cave,
          only to have it echo back without challenging or changing it.
          An Echo Chamber is a psychological bias that prevents one from thinking critically.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let’s look at another example of a psychological bias: a Confirmation bias.
          A confirmation bias happens when you seek out information that agrees with a belief you have,
          instead of looking at all objective information on the subject. As an example, let’s say Tony believes in astrology.
        </p>
        <p>
          Tony’s zodiac tells him he will find five dollars on the ground that day. Later that morning, he finds money on the ground.
          Tony excitedly rants to everyone he knows that his experience is irrefutable evidence of astrology.
          He doesn’t remember the dozens of times when he found money but his zodiac didn’t say he would,
          or when he didn’t find money even though the zodiac reassured him he would.
          Tony already believed in astrology before he found money on the ground, so he seeks out examples that support his belief,
          forgetting or ignoring contrary facts.
        </p>
        <p>
          It’s doubtful that any reader of this newsletter has such an extreme confirmation bias like Tony’s.
          However, no one is immune to these psychological traps like echo chambers and biases.
        </p>
        <p>
          This newsletter column is about defending your argument. It will help you recognize flaws in an evolutionist’s arguments,
          and how to carefully construct a counter-argument. While you learn, it’s important to remember that sometimes the answer lies somewhere in the middle.
          Not everything is black and white, or left and right.
          Excluding some ideas because you <i>assume</i> you already know the argument
          instead of taking the time to understand it is tribal thinking,
          another psychological bias that will keep you from truly understanding God’s creation.
        </p>
        <p>
          So how does one avoid an Echo Chamber or another psychological bias,
          especially in an age when everyone is only a few clicks away from hearing whatever opinion that will confirm their bias?
          The answer is: by talking to people and engaging with ideas that differ from yours.
          Keeping your sources diverse, from all different backgrounds and schools of thought, maintains a healthy, well-tested argument,
          one that can stand its ground against any refutation.
          It is important to understand the opposing viewpoint, not only because you will avoid an echo chamber,
          but also because when you fully understand a worldview, you will understand how it is flawed.

        It’s a bird! It’s a plane! Wait a minute… Mimicry, the resemblance of something else,
        is a characteristic displayed in a variety of creatures, by both the hunter and the hunted.
        So what’s the big deal with mimicry?
      </p>
      <p>
        There are many kinds of mimicry. We will cover two today. One type of mimicry that harmless prey often use is the imitation of something harmful.
        For example, some hoverflies have bright yellow warning colorations that are almost indistinguishable from stinging bees. Another kind of mimicry is one used by the predator.
        This kind of mimicry involves deceiving the prey by pretending to be one of them.
        One such example is a certain kind of ant-hunting spider, which looks and smells like its prey, a weaver ant.

        Mimicry is an example of the result of mutations and genetic change. Then doesn’t this mean that the theory of evolution is right? No.
        The kinds as presented in the Bible probably refer best to scientific families. Adaption within these families is just the loss of some of the original genetic diversity.
        God’s creation of mimicry clearly illustrates his care for all his creatures. How much more does he care for every one of us!

          you know what I mean—that I have the capacity of being more wicked than any example that man could set me,
          and that if I escape, it is only by God's grace helping me to get rid of myself, partially in science, more completely in society,
          — but not perfectly except by committing myself to God as the instrument of His will,
          not doubtfully, but in the certain hope that that Will will be plain enough at the proper time.

          It is always important to know what you are doing. It is also important to let others know what you are doing.
          IOCS has been doing a lot, for example, in our newsletter we feature photos, articles, and more.
          But is that the IOCS' goal? To take photos or to defeat evolution?
        </p>
        <p class="indent">
          The answer to those questions is a definite <b>no</b>. We are not here to show what we can do, what we can accomplish.
          For if we were, we could not and would not survive very long. And even if we did, our photos and articles will have no power.
          They would be empty.
        </p>
        <p class="indent">
          But our primary focus is to glorify God in all that we do. For we can do anything with God’s strength (Philippians 4:13).
          God is the one on whom we are looking to all times.
        </p>
        <p class="indent">
          This is a reminder and reaffirmation both to IOCS members and to our readers.
          We are not here to elevate ourselves or our organization, but to reach the unreachable (Matthew 28:19-20),
