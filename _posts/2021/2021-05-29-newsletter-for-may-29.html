                True or False: Carbon-14 and other dating methods scientifically and accurately prove the evolutionary theory.
              </p>
              <p  class="indent">
                Let’s start out with the definition of scientific proof. The scientific method says that everything must be repeatable in the present,
                meaning it must be observable. Dating methods estimate how old something is. But in order to be scientific,
                someone had to be looking when that item was being formed.
              </p>
              <p  class="indent">
                Dating methods also use many assumptions. Carbon dating measures the rate of carbon-14 breakdown.
                However, in order for this method to work,
                one would have to guess the amount of carbon was existent before the breakdown,
                and that the rate was the same in the past as in the present.
              </p>
              <p  class="indent">
                Dating methods don’t agree with evolution. In Sydney, Australia,
                a fossil piece of wood was discovered in sandstone supposedly 225-230 million years old.
                When they carbon-tested it, it was about 33,700 years old. That’s a huge gap!
                Additionally, in East Africa, there is an area called KBS tuff. When scientists first measured the date of the area,
                they came up with an age of around 220 million. This date did not agree with the fossils,
                so they came up with a more recent date of 2.6 million. Then,
                a skull was discovered beneath the tuff that looked younger than the tuff.
                They redated the tuff again and finally came up with 1.8 million years.

            </span>
            <p  class="indent">
              Coprolite. A cool word, isn’t it? Although the origin of this type of fossil, coprolite,
              is rather fetid (literally) and often avoided,
              coprolite shines a lot of light on the error of evolution.
              Animal feces (unfossilized coprolite) dissolves and decays rather quickly,
              so it is shocking and surprising to find these sorts of fossils. If, as Evolution says,
              coprolites were formed while being slowly buried, not-yet-fossilized-coprolite wouldn’t stand a chance!
              They would surely dissolve by weathering, bacteria, and suffer the danger of being crushed.
              And this is all the more so because we have found coprolites that came from marine creatures!
              (We all know that water dissolves not-yet-fossilized-coprolite faster than on land.)
              Another problem is the "fresh appearance" of lots of coprolite. In order for the coprolite to stay
              in good condition, it must stay fresh and moist. But if a piece of you-know-what laid for a long time,
              it would undoubtedly be dried, and so, cracked and powdery. And even if the coprolite did stay fresh and wet,
              the feces would be no longer fresh, but muck.
            </p>
            <p  class="indent">
              Many paleontologists and scientists fumble around, trying to explain the formation of coprolite.
              Evolutionists try saying that coprolites are rare; this would give some backing to gradual burial.
              Not going to work...coprolites are actually abundant, especially the ones which originated in water!
              Not to mention that this doesn’t explain how coprolites formed without a form of interruption or disturbance.
              Additionally, coprolites, dated back to the 9th century, have been located.
              This suggests that fossils form quickly. In this example, only a thousand or so years ago.
              So, no need to wait for the millions of years that Evolution insists on.
              The most adequate idea of the formation of coprolites is explained in the Bible.
            </p>
            <p  class="indent">
              In Genesis 6-8, God tells us about the Flood. In Genesis 6:17, God says:
            </p>
            <p  class="indent">
              <i>“And, behold, I, even I, do bring a flood of waters upon the earth,
                to destroy all flesh, wherein is the breath of life, from under heaven;
                and every thing that is in the earth shall die.”</i>
            </p>
            <p  class="indent">
              Now, for Noah’s flood to kill all of humanity and life on the entire planet,
              the flood would have been highly catastrophic and the erosion rates would have been massive,
              which would result in very rapid burial. In Genesis 8:2, God says:
            </p>
            <p  class="indent">
              <i>“The fountains also of the deep and the windows of heaven were stopped,
                and the rain from heaven was restrained;”</i>
            </p>
            <p  class="indent">
              The “fountains of the deep” would mean that the Flood was so highly catastrophic,
              it would have been very different from the tropical storms we have today.
              The earth would have literally split open and water would have burst out.
              And in saying “the windows of heaven,” the rain would be basically bombing the earth.
              Everything would have been buried, including animal wastes, and because of the high catastrophism and erosion,
              no bacteria would have been able to decay the wastes. The result would be fossilized dung.
            </p>
            <p  class="indent">
              In a last effort, one argument is: “Doesn’t water turn not-yet-fossilized-coprolite into muck?
              Coprolites look exactly like what their original shape was; so if the Flood, if it existed washed onto coprolite,
              wouldn’t they dissolve?” Yes, water does dissolve unfossilized-coprolite,
              and if a normal flash flood (like Evolution might suggest) washed onto coprolite,
              it would dissolve without a doubt. But the Flood was unlike any of the floods we have ever seen.
              It would have carried tons of sediment as it engulfed the earth, because of this,
              the coprolites would have been buried in an instant.
            </p>
            <p  class="indent">
              This explicitly explains that all things in this universe, from the greatest beasts,
              even to things we wrinkle our noses at can point to an Intelligent Designer, our Creator God.
              Like all the other fossils, coprolite comfirms that we should do just as Psalm 9:1 instructs:
              "<I>I will praise thee, O Lord, with my whole heart; I will shew forth all thy marvellous works.</I>"

              What happens to a chicken bone that gets left outside in the yard?
              Most of the time a dog or cat or other animal eats it or buries it in the ground.
              But what would happen if it were buried very quickly? It might turn into a chicken bone fossil.
              When it is fossilized, it will be completely replaced by minerals, and become rock solid.
              So, if you dug the chicken bone up, it would be a very hard, rocky replica.

            <p style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;line-height: 1.5;font-size:16px;" class="indent">
              This process is common with dinosaur bones.
              Most scientists who believe in evolution will tell you that fossils from dinosaurs are over 60 million years old.
              But that simply cannot be true. Fairly recently,
              something happened that disproves the idea that dinosaur fossils are millions of years old.
              Scientists uncovered a fossil from a Tyrannosaurus Rex. But when they broke the fossil open,
              it still had soft tissues. They had not been replaced by rocky minerals.
              It is obviously not possible for soft tissue to last millions of years even if it were buried underground.
              It would have decayed or had been fossilized.

              The excuse scientists come up for this is that it “somehow” lasted 65 million years.
              But that is an outright farce. This helps us see that dinosaurs are not millions,
              but thousands of years old, and were created by a single God.

            Today’s creature of the week is a boring old–I mean, incredibly extraordinary, beetle.
            Click beetles are any of the 7,000 species in the family Elateridae.<sup style="font-size:10px">1</sup> In terms of appearance,
            most are quite commonplace, usually showing up in a coat of brown or black.

                Wood Ticks bite and can spread diseases like Rocky Mountain spotted fever.
                Although it may take a while,
                it is always wise to check yourself often when exploring, hiking, or doing another outdoor activity.
                If you are bitten by a tick, take a look at <a style="color:#876820; text-decoration:none;" href="https://www.cdc.gov/ticks/removing_a_tick.html">this link</a> from the CDC.

            If a click beetle happens to be in danger, it will flip upside down and play dead.
            Most predators won’t be interested in eating something dead. When the danger has gone by,
            the click beetle turns over. Simple, isn’t it? No. “Turns over” is an understatement.
            Most beetles, when flipped on their back, find it rather difficult to flip right-side up.
            They usually flail their legs about wildly until one foot catches onto the ground or a nearby object.
            Using this leg as an anchor, they are able to pivot. But if the legs never catch onto anything,
            the beetle can’t turn over. The click beetle never has to take such a risk. It can jump. In the photo above,
            you can see a spine on the thorax (midsection) of the click beetle.
            A click beetle bends its body and notches the spine into a crevice in the abdomen (back-section).
            This uses the principle of potential energy since at this position, a muscle in the body is stretched.
            When the spine is unnotched, the click beetle’s body suddenly straightens, sending the bug into the air,
            where it will turn around and land onto its feet.<sup style="font-size:10px">2</sup>
            This is sort of like a rubber band. If it is stretched, lots of potential energy is stored.
            When it is released, the energy is let free, and the rubber band flies out of sight.

            What an amazing Designer! Indeed, the author of Psalm 92:5 was 100% correct in saying,

            Ticks <i>are</i> enabled with remarkable abilities to locate hosts,
            but they also display God’s great care for us by giving us an escape from tick-transmitted diseases.
