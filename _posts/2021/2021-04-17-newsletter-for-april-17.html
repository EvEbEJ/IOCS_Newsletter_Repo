          Irreducible Complexity</h2>

        <span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;line-height: 1.5;font-size:16px;width:60px;">
          <span class="quote-span" style="color:#003570;">
          </span>
          <p style="" class="indent">
            Have you ever seen something so complex that if it were not put together by someone with the knowledge,
            it would not work? Have you come across anything that, if it were missing just one part, would be useless?
          </p>
          <p style="" class="indent">
            This is the concept of <b>irreducible complexity</b>, literally, complexity which cannot be reduced.
            If irreducibly complex organisms or functions existed, evolution would have a huge wall to jump.
            Why? Evolution says that organisms were built step by step, from simple compounds to complex creatures.
            Now, irreducibly complex objects do not work unless all the components are there.
            Suppose evolution was making a clock. Now clocks are made of gears. If even one gear was missing…
            the whole clock would go bonkers. Evolution would have to create the clock spontaneously.
            The only other option is for evolution to build the clock, gear by gear, knowing the end result.
            Evolution is based on slow, predictable processes (or at least is supposed to be).
            The first option can be discarded.
            Now, evolution is mindless, so the second one is ruled out too.
          </p>
          <p style="" class="indent">
            Here’s an extremely simple example. Most animals have lungs and a heart.
            If the heart evolved first, it would not be able to obtain any oxygen.
            However, if the lungs evolved first, they would die because without a heart,
            there is no blood circulation. With no oxygen getting to the cells, the whole organism dies.
          </p>
          <p style="" class="indent">
            Therefore, irreducible complexity is exceedingly difficult to overcome for evolution.
            Just as a light bulb without light would not exist, so also animals only partly evolved won’t exist either.
            They would have to be fully functional to be the fittest. Evolution does not guarantee such a luxury to links,
            instead, it offers death. Therefore, everything in all creation shows that there really is a God.

            Wood is used for many things. Most houses, fences, tables, chairs, and shelves are all made of wood.
            In fact, 7% of the surface of the earth is trees (that’s over 1 million square miles!)! Unsurprisingly,
            since the earth is covered with trees, we also find many fossils of trees, which we call “petrified wood,”
            which appears to be wood, but is really rock.
          </p>
          <p style="" class="indent">
            According to evolution, trees began to peek from the earth 400 million years ago.
            They claim that the petrified wood forms when trees fall and are buried with sediments,
            such as mud and volcanic ash, and after a few million years, the trees would become petrified wood.
          </p>
          <p style="" class="indent">
            This is invalid. We have observed real specimens of petrified wood that still have splinters on them!
            This could only form by a quick, rapid, air-tight burial. Otherwise,
            splinters would be weathered away by constant erosion (consider driftwood).
          </p>
          <p style="" class="indent">
            Then, there is also the entire bacteria and decomposition problem.
          </p>
          <p style="" class="indent">
            Additionally, we see petrified tree fossils that stand in many layers of rock,
            which evolutionists claim to have formed over millions and billions of years. Right. So,
            how could a tree stand up for millions of years again? The oldest tree that is still standing is
            younger than 10,000 years old. 10,000 years only 1% of a million years.
            So how can a tree stand up for a million years,
            much less the <i>millions of years</i> that it would take for a single layer of rock to be laid!
          </p>
          <p style="" class="indent">
            Not to mention the fact that trees that have fallen and lie around usually make an extraordinarily lovely home for bugs and worms.
            In petrified wood, we don’t often find bugs.
            This means that fresh trees were fossilized and that some trees were not lying around for millions of years.
          </p>
          <p style="" class="indent">
            All of this evolutionary talk is in reality human ideas and thought and not true science.
          </p>
          <p style="" class="indent">
            According to Creation, all trees were buried by a global, catastrophic flood.
            This makes sense because then layers of sediment could be laid down very rapidly.
            Fortunately for trees, petrified wood no longer has to stand for a million years.
            Also, the flood occurred about 6000 years ago,
            and if the flood destroyed all the trees that had begun to grow before the flood,
            then it would make sense if the oldest living tree is 5000 years old,
            which should have sprouted soon after the flood.
          </p>
          <p style="" class="indent">
            Even trees, simple though they seem, the things that we see every day, can display the perfectness of God, and the extreme error of evolution.

            Most modern scientists will tell you that we have not the slightest idea of how the dinosaurs and many other ancient creatures went extinct.
            We know that many species of dinosaurs have been around living with humans after the flood.
            Why then do these magnificent animals of God’s creation no longer walk the Earth?

            As a result of sin, death, killing, and suffering has entered the world.
            But this did not affect just humans. It affects the animals too.
            They suffered as a result. Humans have been killing animals for food, materials, and,
            sadly, for sport as long as we know. We see that God told Noah:

            People, having the upper hand, have driven animals out of their habitats, and slaughtered them.
            For years and years, this has been the case, and now a staggering amount of animals are extinct,
            a part of God’s creation just like us.
            This is why there are now many endangered species programs that help protect the creatures that have dwindling numbers.
            If you were to talk to one of these people that supports these programs it might go like this:
          </p>
          <p style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;line-height: 1.5;font-size:16px;
          margin-left:30px;margin-right:50px;color:#20999f" class="indent">
            “Excuse me, Mr. Scientist, can you tell me why you have an endangered species program?”
          </p>
          <p style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;line-height: 1.5;font-size:16px;
          margin-left:30px;margin-right:50px;color:#e55f02" class="indent">
            “It’s so obvious, isn’t it? Lots of species of animals have become extinct,
            like the Australian Eastern Hare Wallaby in 1890, the Indonesian Bali Tiger in 1937,
            the Mexican Silver Grizzly Bear in 1964, and recently, the Northern White Rhinoceros,
            in which there are no males left in the world. Scientists estimate that, on average,
            we lose one to three species of animals every day from the Earth.
            Lots of animals are on our endangered species list. We’ve lost thousands of species.
            We are trying to stop animals from becoming extinct.”

            “Why? It should be obvious! Here are just a few of the MANY reasons. Look around the Earth and observe:
            famines, droughts, floods, fire, diseases, people killing them for food are materials,
            people destroying their habitats, and animals killing each other. These are just a few of the reasons.
            Everyone should know these things.”

            Actually, we <i>do know</i> what happened to the dinosaurs! Because of sin, the Curse, and the Flood,
            we now have such things as famines, droughts, floods, fire, diseases,
            people killing them for food are materials, people destroying their habitats,
            and animals killing each other. In other words, the same reasons that animals become extinct today,
            are the <b>same reasons</b> that dinosaurs died out. And it was not millions of years ago,
            it was probably thousands or possibly just hundreds of years ago. There is no mystery whatsoever.

          Many bugs and insects dwell in watery marshes and ponds. Some of these include water striders,
          water spiders, and all sorts of larvae and pupae (mosquitos, dragonflies, caddis flies, etc.).
          One creature, the backswimmer, is most unique. The backswimmer (<i>Notonectidae</i>)<sup style="font-size:10px">1</sup> lives worldwide,
          like many other aquatic bugs/insects. Backswimmers eat other insects, and sometimes, small animals,
          like small tadpoles and fish.
        </p>
        <p style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;line-height: 1.5;font-size:16px;" class="indent">
          Backswimmers have many forms of transportation. True to their name,
          these bottom dwellers swim upside down. In addition to their boat-like built bodies,
          by quickly paddling their long hind legs (like oars), backswimmers zip with agility through the water.
          Not only are these “oars” handy for helping these insects chase a fleeing snack, but also for escape.
          Backswimmers can fly too! If feeling threatened and seeing no escape, backswimmers could leap out of the water
          and quickly glide out of sight.<sup style="font-size:10px">2</sup> How amazing is that? A boat and plane in one! It sounds Intelligently Designed.
        </p>
        <p style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;line-height: 1.5;font-size:16px;" class="indent">
          Even the backswimmer, which is only 0.625 inches long (≈ 1.6 cm), is cared greatly and fervently by the Creator,
          who granted it a deft way of transportation. Once again, Matthew 10:28-30 brings us a great reminder,
          that God cares for all of his creatures, but more than that, He cares for us. This is something to thank God for.
