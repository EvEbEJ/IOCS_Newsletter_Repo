          <p>
            The first passage we’re looking at is not even in Genesis! It’s in Exodus 20:8-11:
          </p>
          <p>“Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy. <b>Six days</b> you shall labor, and do all your work,
            but the seventh day is a Sabbath to the Lord your God.
            On it you shall not do any work, you, or your son, or your daughter, your male servant, or your female servant,
            or your livestock, or the sojourner who is within your gates.
            For <b>in six days</b> the Lord made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that is in them,
            and rested on the seventh day. Therefore the Lord blessed the Sabbath day and made it holy.”
          </p>
          <p>
            The two times the phrase ‘six days’ appears here are parallel.
            The first occurrence, as with the rest of the Ten Commandments, is obviously literal.
            God is commanding the Israelites to work on six days of the seven-day week.
            The second occurrence is where the dispute begins. Is “day” literal, figurative, or metaphorical?
            In this case, it has to be literal because of the context, so a paraphrase would be:
            “You shall work six literal days and rest on the seventh because God created the world in six literal days and rested on the seventh.”
          </p>
          <p>
            The second passage is a snippet of Genesis 1. Verse 5 says, “God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night.
            And there was evening and there was morning, the first day.” The last sentence is repeated over and over again. It is easily overlooked.
            However, there is a meaning to it, especially in relating to the
            <a href="https://talkiocs.blogspot.com/2021/03/theistic-evolution-bible-part-1.html" style="color:dodgerblue">six-day creation</a>.
            Every time evening and morning are mentioned along with the Hebrew word for day,
            it denotes a literal, 24-hour day. In addition, every other time in the Bible an ordinal number
            (e.g. “first,” “second,” etc.) is mentioned before the Hebrew “day,” it refers to a normal, literal day.<sup style="font-size:10px">1</sup>

            One question that has been repeatedly asked over the centuries is “How old is the earth?”
            Many theories, ideas, and presuppositions have been struggling to achieve the title of “winner” in this race.
            Two of these are Creation and Evolution. Let's look at their views.
          </p>
          <h3>Biblical Account</h3>
          <p>
            The Bible's account is simple. Taking the literal Genesis account, we find that Adam was created on the 6th day.
            From Adam to Abraham, there were approximately 2000 years. And Abraham lived about 2000 years before Christ.
            So if we add 5 days, 2000 years from Adam to Abraham, 2000 years from Abraham to the birth of Jesus,
            and 2000 years from Jesus's birth until now, we get about 6000 years. Simple and comprehensive.
          </p>
          <p>
            In his <i>Chronology of the Old Testament</i>, Dr. Floyd Jones graphs a list of chronologists who calculated the age of the earth according to the Bible.
            The results varied about 1000 years from about 5000 to 4000 B.C., which is only some 6000 years ago.
            The reason for the variation could have been two things:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>Instead of using the Hebrew Masoretic text, the chronologists used the Septuagint or another early translation.
              The Septuagint is a Greek version of the Hebrew Masoretic made in 250 B.C. by some 70 Jewish translators.
              Although mostly correct, some unclarities exist.
            </li>
            <li>
              Some periods in the Bible are not crystal clear in the time extent. A deep study must be invested in such areas to get an accurate account.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            A foundation of the age of the earth on a Biblical basis would conspicuously be pointing to an earth not more than 7000 years old.
          </p>
          <h3>Old Earth Account</h3>
          <p>
            Evolution is an old-earth science, meaning it teaches that the earth is billions of years old.<sup style="font-size:10px">1</sup>
            In 1779, Comte de Buffon build the idea that the earth was approximately 78,000 years old.
            From there the 78,000 years were reformed into one million years, and finally, after radiometric dating was introduced in the 20th century,
            Clair Patterson calculated the monstrous date of 4.5 billion years in 1956. Now, radiometric dating is the “trusty-dusty” method to date the earth.
            In radiometric dating, elements undergo what is called radioactive decay, which then produces other elements.
            Then, scientists measure the remaining radioactive elements and the elements that were produced to date the earth.
            Using this method, they date rocks that are “extremely old” to determine the earth’s age.
            Zircon rocks, which are claimed to be durable, have been tested for age. In Australia, such rocks were used for testing.
            Evolutionists “found out” that this rock was 4.378 billion years old, which meant that the earth could be older.
            If the earth were classified as billions of years old, Evolution could easily state that anything could happen over millions of years.
          </p>
          <h3>Old Earth Woes</h3>
          <p>
            But there are problems with this theory. Radiometric dating is unfortunately increasingly unstable.<sup style="font-size:10px">2</sup>
            Radiometric dating consists of the constant decaying of radioactive elements.
          </p>
          <p>
            The constant rhythm would lead us to the number of radioactive elements that the rock contains at the present moment.
            So, in order to figure out the final result, the testing scientist would have to use an assumption to guess the number of radioactive elements the rock started out with,
            or, the original state of the rock. With this assumption, scientists could then calculate the age of the earth.
            The problem is, Evolutionary-biased scientists would automatically assume that the amount of radioactive element
            in a test rock's original status would be millions, perhaps, like the zircon, billions of years old!
            Not to mention that for the calculations to be accurate, no interruptions could disturb the decay rate.
            And what if the decay slowed, or sped up (perhaps during a global catastrophe)?
            So, when Evolutionists use this dating method, assuming constant consistency, the result is often capricious.
            The result of rocks that underwent the carbon test many times could vary millions of years!
            And one thing that evolutionists do is choose the age that best fits their time frame!
          </p>
          <p>
            Even if these dating methods did somehow line up to 4.5 billion years, can this be reliable and scientific? Not at all!
            Science is observable. No one has witnessed the formation of the earth.
            If the earth were 4.5 billion years old, no one can witness the formation of the earth.
            Clearly, a geologic dating of over 4.5 billion years is unobservable and unobserved, and so, unscientific.
          </p>
          <p>
            One example of erred radiometric dating is Carbon-14. When Carbon-14 dating is used on fossils, we get huge dates.
            But are these accurate? If these fossils, which were doubtlessly dated with radiometric methods,
            how do they contain tissues, cells, and other delicate body parts that are still living?
            Let's take the T. Rex for example. Live tissues from 75-million-year-old T. Rexs have been documented!
            History.com acknowledges the improbability of this, saying:
          </p>
          <p>
            <i>
              "Unlike bones and teeth, which can survive for hundreds of millions of years,
              soft tissues are among the first materials to disappear during the fossilization process."<sup style="font-size:10px">3</sup>
            </i>
          </p>
          <p>
            And this is not all. Tissues have been discovered in trilobites, other dinosaurs, such as the Edmontosaurus,
            and many other creatures.<sup style="font-size:10px">4</sup> This shows us many things.
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>Such radiometric dating methods are unreliable.</li>
            <li>Fossils and the earth are not that old but are younger than the scientific consensus think.</li>
            <li>Evolution is unscientific.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            There are many more issues with Evolution's old-earth doctrine.
            All these woeful errors greatly discredit Evolution. Evolution is a mendacious misconception.
          </p>
          <h3>Conclusion</h3>
          <p>
            Clearly, Evolution and old-earth are not reliable. Sadly, many Christians have rejected the Bible,
            choosing to accept man's unknown philosophies instead. Yet the Bible is errorless and completely reliable.
            <b>Not one man who has ever lived has ever found a single proof that adequately distinguishes the Bible in any way as incorrect.</b>
            Landmarks such as canyons that dot the supposedly million-year-old earth aren’t millions of years old either.
            In the 1980s, Mt. St. Helens, a catastrophic volcano, exploded.
            The explosion was not only loud, but it also carved valleys similar to the canyons around the world in a very short amount of time.
            So it is no shocker that the Flood, which was hundreds of times more powerful than Mount St. Helens,
            could carve these landmarks in a short amount of time. So, it all works. Nothing in the earth is millions of years old,
            from the “oldest rock,” which might only be a few thousand years old, to the great canyons and valleys around the globe,
            and so, everything fits in the Creationist’s time frame.
          </p>
          <p>
            Therefore, it is evident that Creation is perfect in dating the earth.
            <b>In reality, the earth is only about 6000 to 7000 years old.</b>
            Evolution is perfect in fitting what God says in 2 Peter 1:16b. Evolution is one of the many “cleverly devised myths” that many people follow.
            We need to be at all times alert and at the ready, or as the Bible puts it,
            “To that end, keep alert with all perseverance, making supplication for all the saints.” (Ephesians 6:18, ESV)
            Let us make it our goal to do just that.<sup style="font-size:10px">5,6</sup>

            Sea stars, or starfish, are without a doubt some of the most fabulous marine creatures on the planet.
            Sea stars, found in the family <i>Asteroidea</i>, are echinoderms. Sea stars are carnivorous with a unique method of hunting.
            These invertebrates come in all shapes and sizes, and so do their fossils.<sup style="font-size:10px">1</sup>
          </p>
          <p class="indent">
            Because of their great fame, Evolution has a lot to say about these echinoderms.
            According to Evolution, sea stars have been around 500 million years, since the Cambrian period, and have survived the five mass extinctions.
            Fossils from species <i>Cantabrigiaster</i> are one of the suggested transitions between
            <a href="https://talkiocs.blogspot.com/2021/09/crinoids-mouth-full-of-feathers.html" style="color:dodgerblue">crinoids (sea lilies)</a> and sea stars.
          </p>
          <p class="indent">
            Unfortunately, this philosophy is critically erred. First, evidence exhibits the complexity of sea stars even during the Cambrian, 500 million years ago!
            Where is scientific evidence for the transitional ancestors for sea stars?
            Scientists think that sea star ancestors were fragile, lacking a calcite skeleton, and so did not fossilize.
            But this excuse is invalid, because we have found
            <a style="color:dodgerblue" href="https://talkiocs.blogspot.com/2021/02/unsimplified-jellyfish.html">jellyfish fossils</a>,
            which are fragile creatures. What about the <i>Cantabrigiaster</i>?
            The fact is not all Evolutionary sources agree on the <i>Cantabrigiaster</i>. According to the University of Western Australia,
            the evolution of sea stars and brittle stars are still a mystery.<sup style="font-size:10px">2</sup> <i>Cantabrigiaster</i> was probably just a sea star.
            As sad as it seems, the fact is, there is no scientific evidence for sea stars or sea lilies evolving from anything or gaining complexity!
            Additionally, how did sea stars’ evolutionary status remain unchanged for 480 million years?
            All evidence and science shows us that sea stars were always sea stars.
            <a style="color:dodgerblue" href="https://talkiocs.blogspot.com/2021/12/the-survivors-of-5-mass-extinctions.html">How could sea stars survive all five mass extinctions?</a>
            <a style="color:dodgerblue" href="https://talkiocs.blogspot.com/2021/07/the-age-of-earth.html">How could the earth be that old?</a>
            Evolution added a needless, sound-like-science library of sea star variations to lure people to trust in its doctrine.
          </p>
          <p>
            God tells us that He created all marine creatures on the fifth day. And there is no fault in God or His word.
            What science says supports a Creationist’s worldview. God created all animals as they were. Genesis 1:24 says:
          </p>
          <p>
            <i>“And God said, “Let the land produce living creatures according to their kinds: the livestock, the creatures that move along the ground,
            and the wild animals, each according to its kind.” And it was so.”</i>(NIV)
          </p>
          <p>
            From the moment creation began, each creature reproduced after their kind. This could only happen because of not the wondrous works of nature,
            chance, and evolution, but because of the wondrous works of God, the Intelligent Designer.<sup style="font-size:10px">3</sup>

          <p>
            <i>Stegosaurus</i> (“roofed lizard”)<sup style="font-size:10px">1</sup> is a famous dinosaur with iconic alternating<sup style="font-size:10px">2</sup> plates along its back.
            They are found in Jurassic-layer rocks. The functionality of the plates is questionable.
            However, the current hypothesis is that these plates helped to cool off the Stegosaurus.<sup style="font-size:10px">3</sup>
            The Stegosaurus also had two pairs of menacing spikes at the end of its tail. It may have been used as a defense mechanism.
          </p>
          <p>
            One of the most significant appearances of Stegosaurus at Angkor, an ancient ruin in Cambodia.<sup style="font-size:10px">4</sup>
            Here is a stone carving that shows a relatively accurate depiction of a stegosaur. In fact, many of the ways the stegosaurus is depicted
            (for example, how it stands) seem to tell us that the sculptor carved it from a real-life encounter! This totally discredits evolution,
            which says that dinosaurs died off millions of years before men. Instead, it supports the Bible and creation.
            It says that the creation of man and land animals (including dinosaurs) took place on the same day! God’s word is not only infallible
            but it is affirmed constantly.

          Science versus the Bible

          <p>
            Which is more reliable, science or the Bible? Wait! Before we answer that, we have to understand a few things.
          </p>
          <p>
            First, what is science? Science is defined as a process used to solve problems or develop an understanding of natural events.
            The keyword here is ‘process’. Science is not a book of facts constantly being revised and updated;
            science is a thorough and precise way of obtaining evidence concerning the natural world.<sup style="font-size:10px">1</sup>
          </p>
          <p>
            Another important thing to remember is that science tends to agree with Christianity.
            For example, the Goldilocks Zone is a term scientists use to describe that Earth is in the exact right spot for life.<sup style="font-size:10px">2</sup>
            If the earth were a smidge farther from the sun or a smidge closer, there would be zero life on Earth.
            As another example, neutrons and protons, two fundamental parts of every atom, are at the perfect ratio to sustain life.
            If the weight of neutrons were just a little bit lighter, or protons just a smidge heavier, the universe wouldn’t exist.
            This, as well as many other reasons, is why scientists characterize our universe as the ‘fine-tuned universe’.<sup style="font-size:10px">3</sup>
            Scientists are constantly discovering new things about how perfect our world is, how the Earth was specifically designed for human life.
            The scientific process is based on the assumption that the universe is ordered and lawful.
            You literally can not be a scientist if you do not assume that there are laws in the universe that we can discover, a deeply Christian idea.
            To put it in Albert Einstein’s words: “The most Incomprehensible thing about the universe is that it is comprehensible”. <sup style="font-size:10px">4</sup>
          </p>
          <p>
            Now that you know all this information: Which is more reliable, science or the Bible? It’s a trick question.
            Both science and the Bible are ways to understand God: Science is a process that helps us learn about God’s creation,
            and the Bible is the Word of God. The two were never at odds. So why would that question even be asked?
          </p>
          <p>
            The answer is quite simple. When in an argument, it would be an automatic win to frame your opponent as someone who is not factually based
            or someone who ‘doesn’t believe in science.'' If you are having a conversation with an atheist and they ask you this question,
            they are baiting you into a trap: They want you to say ‘the Bible’, so they can say that Christians aren’t grounded in the real world.
            The question is set up for the answerer to commit a logical fallacy
            because if you believe that God created the world, but you don’t believe in science,
            you have automatically lost the argument. Whichever way you answer the question ‘which is more reliable, science or the Bible?’,
            you are conceding that science and the Bible are contradictory. If you answer science, then that implies that the Bible (the word of God) isn’t as reliable as man-made discoveries,
            but if you answer the Bible, you imply that science contradicts the Bible, or is inadequate in some other way.
            Both science and the Bible are designed to be reliable sources of truth. By choosing one over the other you concede that one of them is faulty.
          </p>
          <p>
            I know what you are thinking, “What should I say when someone asks me, ‘which is more reliable, the science or the Bible?’”
            The obvious answer is to stop engaging in discussion with that person, for they clearly are not actually seeking truth and are just looking to cross-examine you on your faith.
            However, if you’re feeling especially evangelical, you could reply along the lines of, “Is it possible to believe in only one?
            How can you believe science without acknowledging that many scientific discoveries point to a lawful and ordered universe with a Creator?”
            God created the universe. Science is a vessel for understanding God’s creation in the same way that the Bible is a tool to understand God Himself.
            When you defend your faith, remember the universe and its Creator is on your side.

          Rodents. What do you think of when you hear the word ‘Rodent?’ Perhaps you envision a large rat, or a mouse scurrying away in the bushes.
          But the rodent boundary far surpasses rats and mice. Rodents<sup style="font-size:10px">1</sup> (order <i>Rodentia</i>) are found in family <i>Mammalia</i>.
          They can be identified by the pairs of incisors protruding from the upper and lower parts of their mouth.
          Amazingly, God designed these teeth to grow seemingly endlessly! There are about 2,050 living species of rodents!
          That’s almost half of all creature species found in the family <i>Mammalia</i>! Rodents can be located everywhere, except for Antarctica,
          New Zealand, and some islands that dot various oceans. Because of their high involvement with human society, some places include invasive species.

          Rodents are creatively designed by God to exhibit an essential role in nature.
          These critters are indispensable for the vast food chain network.
          They convert platters of vegetation into a meal for a desperate carnivorous creature (by being themselves the meal).<sup style="font-size:10px">3</sup>
          This order is also a key player in landscaping. The many extensive passageways that they tunnel provide plants’ roots with much-needed oxygen,
          water, and carbon dioxide. It also redistributes the stagnant topsoil, giving other creatures access to a healthier climate.<sup style="font-size:10px">4</sup>
          They are also important for the dispersing of seeds and spores, as well as pollination, seed predation, and much more.<sup style="font-size:10px">5</sup>
        </p>
        <p>
          Rodents are clearly Intelligently Designed. God designed rodents on the 6th day of creation for a purpose.
          Rodents may be small, the largest (the Capybara), being only about 2 feet.
          And yet God intricately fashioned them to replenish the earth in countless, beneficial ways.
          And that same God is looking out for you and me! Isn’t our God so awesome and loving?
          So the next time you see a rodent of any kind, admire how such a little one was carefully designed by God,
          the same God who loves you and me.

            It is always important to know what you are doing. It is also important to let others know what you are doing.
            IOCS has been doing a lot, for example, in our newsletter we feature photos, articles, and more.
            But is that the IOCS' goal? To take photos or to defeat evolution?
          </p>
          <p class="indent">
            The answer to those questions is a definite <b>no</b>. We are not here to show what we can do, what we can accomplish.
            For if we were, we could not and would not survive very long. And even if we did, our photos and articles will have no power.
            They would be empty.
          </p>
          <p class="indent">
            But our primary focus is to glorify God in all that we do. For we can do anything with God’s strength (Philippians 4:13).
            God is the one on whom we are looking to all times.
          </p>
          <p class="indent">
            This is a reminder and reaffirmation both to IOCS members and to our readers.
            We are not here to elevate ourselves or our organization, but to reach the unreachable (Matthew 28:19-20),
            and to do the impossible (Luke 1:37) to God’s glory.
