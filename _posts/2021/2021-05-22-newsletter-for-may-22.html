              Have you ever heard of "vestigial" organs? Now a disregarded hypothesis,
              vestigial organs refer to degenerated bodily organs that lack a function, in other words,
              vestigial organs are organs that don't do anything. (To name a few the tonsils and the appendix.)
              Since evolutionary thinking labeled these body parts "vestigial,"
              little research had been done on these so-called "vestigial" organs and thereby hindering scientific discoveries.
              Why? Because recently, scientists have discovered that most, if not all, of the previously called "vestigial" organs,
              actually do have functions!
            </p>
            <p  class="indent">
              Earlier this month, Ireland has produced its first dinosaur fossil! Correction: earlier this month,
              Ireland has identified a fossil found in the 1980s to be a dinosaur! What caused the delay? Evolution.
              The dinosaur was discovered in marine rocks and clearly, dinosaurs are not marine!
            </p>
            <p  class="indent">
              These two mistakes and many more might have not occurred if evolutionary hindrances were not present.
              The Creation account shows that all God created was good. Noah's Flood easily explains a dinosaur in oceanic debris.
              The Bible definitely aids scientific discoveries.

            Coprolite. A cool word, isn’t it? Although the origin of this type of fossil, coprolite,
            is rather fetid (literally) and often avoided,
            coprolite shines a lot of light on the error of evolution.
            Animal feces (unfossilized coprolite) dissolves and decays rather quickly,
            so it is shocking and surprising to find these sorts of fossils. If, as Evolution says,
            coprolites were formed while being slowly buried, not-yet-fossilized-coprolite wouldn’t stand a chance!
            They would surely dissolve by weathering, bacteria, and suffer the danger of being crushed.
            And this is all the more so because we have found coprolites that came from marine creatures!
            (We all know that water dissolves not-yet-fossilized-coprolite faster than on land.)
            Another problem is the "fresh appearance" of lots of coprolite. In order for the coprolite to stay
            in good condition, it must stay fresh and moist. But if a piece of you-know-what laid for a long time,
            it would undoubtedly be dried, and so, cracked and powdery. And even if the coprolite did stay fresh and wet,
            the feces would be no longer fresh, but muck.
          </p>
          <p  class="indent">
            Many paleontologists and scientists fumble around, trying to explain the formation of coprolite.
            Evolutionists try saying that coprolites are rare; this would give some backing to gradual burial.
            Not going to work...coprolites are actually abundant, especially the ones which originated in water!
            Not to mention that this doesn’t explain how coprolites formed without a form of interruption or disturbance.
            Additionally, coprolites, dated back to the 9th century, have been located.
            This suggests that fossils form quickly. In this example, only a thousand or so years ago.
            So, no need to wait for the millions of years that Evolution insists on.
            The most adequate idea of the formation of coprolites is explained in the Bible.
          </p>
          <p  class="indent">
            In Genesis 6-8, God tells us about the Flood. In Genesis 6:17, God says:
          </p>
          <p  class="indent">
            <i>“And, behold, I, even I, do bring a flood of waters upon the earth,
              to destroy all flesh, wherein is the breath of life, from under heaven;
              and every thing that is in the earth shall die.”</i>
          </p>
          <p  class="indent">
            Now, for Noah’s flood to kill all of humanity and life on the entire planet,
            the flood would have been highly catastrophic and the erosion rates would have been massive,
            which would result in very rapid burial. In Genesis 8:2, God says:
          </p>
          <p  class="indent">
            <i>“The fountains also of the deep and the windows of heaven were stopped,
              and the rain from heaven was restrained;”</i>
          </p>
          <p  class="indent">
            The “fountains of the deep” would mean that the Flood was so highly catastrophic,
            it would have been very different from the tropical storms we have today.
            The earth would have literally split open and water would have burst out.
            And in saying “the windows of heaven,” the rain would be basically bombing the earth.
            Everything would have been buried, including animal wastes, and because of the high catastrophism and erosion,
            no bacteria would have been able to decay the wastes. The result would be fossilized dung.
          </p>
          <p  class="indent">
            In a last effort, one argument is: “Doesn’t water turn not-yet-fossilized-coprolite into muck?
            Coprolites look exactly like what their original shape was; so if the Flood, if it existed washed onto coprolite,
            wouldn’t they dissolve?” Yes, water does dissolve unfossilized-coprolite,
            and if a normal flash flood (like Evolution might suggest) washed onto coprolite,
            it would dissolve without a doubt. But the Flood was unlike any of the floods we have ever seen.
            It would have carried tons of sediment as it engulfed the earth, because of this,
            the coprolites would have been buried in an instant.
          </p>
          <p  class="indent">
            This explicitly explains that all things in this universe, from the greatest beasts,
            even to things we wrinkle our noses at can point to an Intelligent Designer, our Creator God.
            Like all the other fossils, coprolite comfirms that we should do just as Psalm 9:1 instructs:
            "<I>I will praise thee, O Lord, with my whole heart; I will shew forth all thy marvellous works.</I>"

            What happens to a chicken bone that gets left outside in the yard?
            Most of the time a dog or cat or other animal eats it or buries it in the ground.
            But what would happen if it were buried very quickly? It might turn into a chicken bone fossil.
            When it is fossilized, it will be completely replaced by minerals, and become rock solid.

            This process is common with dinosaur bones.
            Most scientists who believe in evolution will tell you that fossils from dinosaurs are over 60 million years old.
            But that simply cannot be true. Fairly recently,
            something happened that disproves the idea that dinosaur fossils are millions of years old.
            Scientists uncovered a fossil from a Tyrannosaurus Rex. But when they broke the fossil open,
            it still had soft tissues. They had not been replaced by rocky minerals.
            It is obviously not possible for soft tissue to last millions of years even if it were buried underground.
            It would have decayed or had been fossilized.

            The excuse scientists come up for this is that it “somehow” lasted 65 million years.
            But that is an outright farce. This helps us see that dinosaurs are not millions,
            but thousands of years old, and were created by a single God.

          Before the Fall, no animals were parasitic or predatory. But after Adam and Eve took their first bite of the forbidden fruit,
          sin and death immediately unleashed a multitude of parasites, one of which is the tick.
          The American Dog Tick (Dermacentor variabilis), also known as the Wood tick, is distinguishable by its brown bodies speckled with white or gray.
          The tick’s shape is an oval with four pairs of legs near its head. Unlike most spiders,
          ticks are slow and their head is tiny compared to the rest of its body.
          Wood Ticks are most active during the early spring to the beginning of summer.<sup style="font-size:10px">1</sup>

              Wood Ticks bite and can spread diseases like Rocky Mountain spotted fever.
              Although it may take a while,
              it is always wise to check yourself often when exploring, hiking, or doing another outdoor activity.
              If you are bitten by a tick, take a look at <a style="color:#876820; text-decoration:none;" href="https://www.cdc.gov/ticks/removing_a_tick.html">this link</a> from the CDC.

          Even though the Dog Tick is renowned not for its fascinating abilities,
            ticks have an out-of-the-ordinary skill, which adds to its dreadful reputation.
            Ticks are slow, but they have an amazing way to locate their victims.
            These sinister pests hang around in brushes and grasses, maliciously waiting for an opportunity to strike a potential host.
            When they are ready to strike, they will use their back legs to hold on to their perch while using their front legs to latch onto their victim.
            But God gave ticks a downside, so giving us an advantage…
            When ticks bite, it could take up to hours for them to bite deep enough to feed, and even then,
            it could take a couple of days for the tick to transmit disease.<sup style="font-size:10px">2</sup>
            This makes it more important to remove ticks on sight. Now all of this is definitely Intelligent Design.

          What an amazing Designer! Indeed, the author of Psalm 92:5 was 100% correct in saying,
          “O Lord, how great are thy works! and thy thoughts are very deep.”
          Ticks <i>are</i> enabled with remarkable abilities to locate hosts,
          but they also display God’s great care for us by giving us an escape from tick-transmitted diseases.
          What an awesome God we serve!
