          The Rule of Twos</h2>

            In animals, most muscles follow the "rule of twos."
            One muscle contracts while the other stretches to move a limb.
            If evolution were true, the two functions would have to evolve at the same time.
          </p>
          <p  class="indent">
            How likely is this? Evolution is a tester, who tests one function at a time.
            Here's my favorite "rule of two." The diaphragm is a muscle that helps people breathe.
            It pulls the lungs in for inhaling and pushes them out for exhaling.
            Let's say evolution had just created an early "diaphragm."
            Suppose the diaphragm only had the 'pulling' function.
            Then the animal could breathe in once... and die.
            Therefore, evolution would have to constantly evolve in sync.
            This is highly inconceivable, even unscientific!

            Wood is used for many things. Most houses, fences, tables, chairs, and shelves are all made of wood.
            In fact, 7% of the surface of the earth is trees (that’s over 1 million square miles!)! Unsurprisingly,
            since the earth is covered with trees, we also find many fossils of trees, which we call “petrified wood,”
            which appears to be wood, but is really rock.
          </p>
          <p  class="indent">
            According to evolution, trees began to peek from the earth 400 million years ago.
            They claim that the petrified wood forms when trees fall and are buried with sediments,
            such as mud and volcanic ash, and after a few million years, the trees would become petrified wood.
          </p>
          <p  class="indent">
            This is invalid. We have observed real specimens of petrified wood that still have splinters on them!
            This could only form by a quick, rapid, air-tight burial. Otherwise,
            splinters would be weathered away by constant erosion (consider driftwood).
          </p>
          <p  class="indent">
            Then, there is also the entire bacteria and decomposition problem.
          </p>
          <p  class="indent">
            Additionally, we see petrified tree fossils that stand in many layers of rock,
            which evolutionists claim to have formed over millions and billions of years. Right. So,
            how could a tree stand up for millions of years again? The oldest tree that is still standing is
            younger than 10,000 years old. 10,000 years only 1% of a million years.
            So how can a tree stand up for a million years,
            much less the <i>millions of years</i> that it would take for a single layer of rock to be laid!
          </p>
          <p  class="indent">
            Not to mention the fact that trees that have fallen and lie around usually make an extraordinarily lovely home for bugs and worms.
            In petrified wood, we don’t often find bugs.
            This means that fresh trees were fossilized and that some trees were not lying around for millions of years.
          </p>
          <p  class="indent">
            All of this evolutionary talk is in reality human ideas and thought and not true science.
          </p>
          <p  class="indent">
            According to Creation, all trees were buried by a global, catastrophic flood.
            This makes sense because then layers of sediment could be laid down very rapidly.
            Fortunately for trees, petrified wood no longer has to stand for a million years.
            Also, the flood occurred about 6000 years ago,
            and if the flood destroyed all the trees that had begun to grow before the flood,
            then it would make sense if the oldest living tree is 5000 years old,
            which should have sprouted soon after the flood.
          </p>
          <p  class="indent">
            Even trees, simple though they seem, the things that we see every day, can display the perfectness of God, and the extreme error of evolution.

            Most modern scientists will tell you that we have not the slightest idea of how the dinosaurs and many other ancient creatures went extinct.
            We know that many species of dinosaurs have been around living with humans after the flood.
            Why then do these magnificent animals of God’s creation no longer walk the Earth?

            As a result of sin, death, killing, and suffering has entered the world.
            But this did not affect just humans. It affects the animals too.
            They suffered as a result. Humans have been killing animals for food, materials, and,
            sadly, for sport as long as we know. We see that God told Noah:

            After the events of sin, the Curse, and the Flood, animals and humans had to compete for food and living space.
            People, having the upper hand, have driven animals out of their habitats, and slaughtered them.
            For years and years, this has been the case, and now a staggering amount of animals are extinct,
            a part of God’s creation just like us.
            This is why there are now many endangered species programs that help protect the creatures that have dwindling numbers.

            the Mexican Silver Grizzly Bear in 1964, and recently, the Northern White Rhinoceros,
            in which there are no males left in the world. Scientists estimate that, on average,
            we lose one to three species of animals every day from the Earth.
            Lots of animals are on our endangered species list. We’ve lost thousands of species.

            Actually, we <i>do know</i> what happened to the dinosaurs! Because of sin, the Curse, and the Flood,
            we now have such things as famines, droughts, floods, fire, diseases,
            people killing them for food are materials, people destroying their habitats,
            and animals killing each other. In other words, the same reasons that animals become extinct today,
            are the <b>same reasons</b> that dinosaurs died out. And it was not millions of years ago,
            it was probably thousands or possibly just hundreds of years ago. There is no mystery whatsoever.

          Camping is a nice pastime, and one sight to view when camping is the lightning bugs. What?
          That’s the firefly. Ah! The firefly (family <i>Lampyridae</i>) is well known all around the globe.
          They are 5 to 25 millimeters long (half to two and a half centimeters). Some consume nectar and pollen,
          others don’t eat, and still others eat elements of all shapes and sizes.<sup style="font-size:10px">1</sup>

          What is it that pops out when the word “firefly” is mentioned? Obviously, people think about their incredible light.
          How do bugs light up? Fireflies use a chemical reaction (the combining of oxygen (O) and calcium (Ca)) to create light.
          This way of producing light is called bioluminescence ("bio-" life + "lumine" light). As adults, fireflies use bioluminescence to attract mates.
          Even when fireflies are larvae (called glowworms), they are bioluminescent, which is how they got their name.
          Similar to a light bulb’s switch, firefly’s lights could turn on when mating and turning off to save energy. A nice addition is that the firefly’s light produces only a little heat.
          This way, the insects won’t suffer the threat of overheating! What a wonderful, amazing, awe-striking ability!
          Looks to me like an Intelligent Designer.<sup style="font-size:10px">2, 3</sup>

          Lightning bugs, insects of no more than 2.5 centimeters, show God’s magnificent work.
          Honestly, could Evolution create such a perfectly suited and perfectly balanced talent and skill?
          Indeed, this little critter explicitly encourages us to magnify
          Psalm 8:1: “O Lord, our Lord, how excellent is thy name in all the earth!...”
          Let us do as Psalm 135 instructs: “Praise ye the Lord. Praise ye the name of the Lord; praise him, O ye servants of the Lord.”
