        Assumptions about Creationism
        </h2>

          <p>
            According to evolution, the first life randomly spawned from a soup combination of amino acids.
            How credible is this story?
          </p>
          <p>
            First, consider the <b>Law of Biogenesis</b> (rephrased): Life only comes from life.<sup style="font-size:10px">1</sup>
            This one law says that living things can only come from living things, not dead!
            While this matches with the biblical creationist’s worldview, it is a roadblock to evolution.
          </p>
          <p>
            OK, you managed to pass the first roadblock, but more await.
            To make a cell (or a bacterium for that matter), you will have to begin with its components.
            One of the simplest components is a protein.
            Now, proteins are themselves made of molecules known as amino acids.
            However, only 20 out of the over 300 amino acids are compatible for life<sup style="font-size:10px">2</sup>.
            The probability of choosing 100 usable amino acids (enough to make a simple protein) is 1/10<sup style="font-size:10px">117</sup>.
            All that to say, just randomly picking the correct acids is nearly impossible.
          </p>
          <p>
            Not only this but in amino acids, there are two forms: left- and right-handed.
            However, only left-handed acids are game. If a right-handed acid ends up in a protein,
            it is unusable for life. The probability of only choosing 100 <b>left-handed amino acids</b>
            (enough to make a simple protein) is 1 over 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,
            or 1 followed by 30 zeros. If we add this to our previous example, we will get 1/10<sup style="font-size:10px">147</sup>.
            Not stumped yet?
          </p>
          <p>
            Now, they also have to be arranged in a correct sequence. Let’s take the example above.
            If we add this factor to our previous probability, we would get 1/10<sup style="font-size:10px;">247</sup>.
          </p>
          <p>
            According to the mathematician Emile Borel,
            any probability lower than 1/10<sup style="font-size:10px;">50</sup> is universally impossible (in other words, 0).
            Our number is 5 times lower! But stay in your seatbelts! There’s more!
          </p>
          <p>
            There is evidence that free oxygen was about in large quantities when life evolved.<sup style="font-size:10px;">3</sup>
            Unfortunately, free oxygen would destroy any possible proteins
            (if any could leap across the probability chasm) which had not yet evolved protection against this chemical.<sup style="font-size:10px;">4</sup>
            However, if there were no oxygen molecules, then ozone, a form of oxygen,
            would not exist either. Ozone, found in the earth’s atmosphere, blocks most of the harmful ultraviolet rays.
            If ozone were missing, UV rays would streak onto the earth, killing any life forms in the process.
          </p>
          <p>
            Additionally, water breaks apart any proteins that are not protected by cell membranes.
          </p>
          <p>
            Here are some common arguments that stand on sand.
          </p>
          <p style="margin-left:20px;" class="doubleindent">
            <i>Natural Selection can pick out the correct ones!</i>
          </p>
          <p>
            Actually—no.
          </p>
          <ol type="a">
            <li>
            <p>
              For natural selection to know which ones are usable,
              it will have to know the end goal, life. Natural selection does not.<sup style="font-size:10px;">5</sup>
            </p>
            </li>
            <li>
            <p>
              Secondly, natural selection cannot be symbolized by a computer program.
              This can produce options extremely quickly (perhaps thousands per second).
              Additionally, computer programs are designed by an intelligent being, man.
              Also, the computer program <b>saves</b> the correct options.
              In option a, we already see that natural selection does not know the right goal.<sup style="font-size:10px;">5</sup>
            </p>
            </li>
            <li>
            <p>
              Third, natural selection only works on living organisms.
              It cannot pick out amino acids, or any other molecule for that matter.<sup style="font-size:10px;">2,5</sup>
            </p>
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p style="margin-left:20px;" class="doubleindent">
            <i>Saying that evolution can’t happen because of a low probability is a </i>Proof by Lack of Evidence<i> logical fallacy.</i>
          </p>
          <p>
            This is a misconception. <i>Proof by lack of evidence</i> only applies to objects that have a chance
            (i.e. which have a chance over 0). This can be seen in this example:
          </p>
          <span class="quadindent">
            <i><p style="margin-left:160px;">Fish: There are no turtles here.</p>
		           <p style="margin-left:160px;">Frog: How come?</p>
		           <p style="margin-left:160px;">Fish: Have you seen any?</p></i>
          </span>
          <p>
            What this fallacy applies to is proof that something happened because there is no proof to contradict that.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, in our case, our probability is 0. Saying that a 6-dot die cannot roll a 7 is not a logical fallacy.
            It is math, and it is definitely true.
          </p>
          <p>
            We’ve already reduced the origin of life to zero chance. What more can we do?
          </p>
          <p>
            Well, proteins are only one of the many ingredients to form a cell.
            We can talk about sugars next (only right-handed sugars can be used,
            while only left-handed amino acids can be used. Confusing, right?). Oh and…
          </p>
          <p>
            I think we had enough. The main idea is obvious (at least it should be): <b>Evolution cannot explain the origin of life</b>.

        <p class="indent">
          Like many other fossils, the name “orthoceras” may sound millions of years old, but in reality, these sea creatures dwelt only 6000 years ago.
          Despite the name, orthoceras were just like modern squids and octopi, only that they, unfortunately, tumbled into extinction.
          Orthoceras were squid-like organisms that dwelt in a narrow and pointed shell, like a snail.
        </p>
        <p class="indent">
          In an effort to demote Creationism, Evolution states that orthoceras are over 400 million years old.<sup style="font-size:10px">1</sup>
          They lived on earth for 200 million years before they became extinct.<sup style="font-size:10px">2</sup>
          Evolution also “masterfully” insists that orthoceras were the ancestor of modern squids.
        </p>
        <p class="indent">
          But how can earth, much less a single orthocera, be 400 million years old? And why did they evolve out of their shells to become squids?
          After all, a shell for modern squids would be extremely helpful in defense and protecting their soft bodies, and it may also provide camouflage.
          Additionally, 200 million years is a very long time for any animal to live on the earth. Scientifically,
          all of these monstrous dates are really just assumptions and words, not scientific facts.
        </p>
        <p class="indent">
          In reality and contrary to what Evolution instructs, Creation teaches that orthoceras were made on the fifth day of the creation week,
          not the millions of years that Evolution so desperately requires. In Genesis 1:20-21, the Bible tells us this:
        </p>
        <p class="indent">
          <i>“And God said, Let the waters bring forth abundantly the moving creature that hath life,
            and fowl that may fly above the earth in the open firmament of heaven. And God created great whales, and every living creature that moveth,
            which the waters brought forth abundantly, after their kind, and every winged fowl after his kind: and God saw that it was good.”
          </i>
        </p>
        <p class="indent">
          Not only were fish, sea reptiles, and pinnipeds created, but every kind of marine creature; this would include the orthocera.
          It is explicit and clear; orthoceras are not products of Evolution and a big bang that happened out of total nothingness.
          Not at all! Rather, orthoceras were fashioned by the world’s Intelligent Designer, showing the power of our Creator God,
          the great majesty of his work, and the perfectness of his Word.
        </p>
        <p class="indent">
          Evolutionists might say in defense, “Well, a fossil is required to be over 10,000 years old,
          so in order for orthoceras to be a <i>real fossil</i>, it must be 10,000 years or more.”
        </p>
        <p class="indent">
          Really? Where is the evidence for this corrupted assumption?
        </p>
        <p class="indent">
          No official record (other than evolutionary texts and evolution-biased study books) makes this statement!
        </p>
        <p class="indent">
          The English Oxford Dictionary simply defines fossils as “the parts of a dead animal or a plant that have become hard and turned into rock.”
          This doesn’t mean: “the parts of a dead animal or a plant that have become hard and turned into a rock that is at least ten thousand years old.”

          As long as something is the remains of an organism, in the form of rock or another substance, it is a fossil.
          There is no scientific evidence that requires a fossil to be over 10,000 years old. All fossils, from plants to animals,
          including orthoceras, do not have to be (and likely are not) 10,000 years old.

          The column, "Dinosaurs of Eden," had been revised into a bi-weekly article. Last week's article:
        </p>
        <p style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;line-height: 1.5;font-size:16px;" class="indent">
          Something to consider is chapter 40 of Job, in the Bible. God describes a creature that matches the physical attributes of some species of dinosaurs.
          While God is talking to Job, God asks him if he had seen the “behemoth.” God describes the animal by saying:
        </p>
        <i><p style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;line-height: 1.5;font-size:16px;" class="indent">
          “Behold now behemoth, which I made with thee; he eateth grass as an ox. Lo now, his strength is in his loins,
          and his force is in the navel of his belly. He moveth his tail like a cedar: the sinews of his stones are wrapped together.
          His bones are as strong pieces of brass; his bones are like bars of iron. He is the chief of the ways of God:
          he that made him can make his sword to approach unto him.”<sup style="font-size:10px;">1</sup>
        </p></i>
        <p style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;line-height: 1.5;font-size:16px;" class="indent">
          Certainly, no animal with the likes of these walks the earth today.
          Many dinosaurs definitely had “tails like cedar trees,” and “bones like beams of brass.”
          Some people would argue that the creature described by God could be a hippopotamus or an elephant,
          but these creatures undoubtedly do not have “tails like cedar trees.” Hippopotamus and elephants and have tiny stubby tails.
          And although the elephant would seem to be “the first of the works of God,” because of its immense weight of about 14,000 pounds,
          it is dwarfed by the titanic sauropods, weighing in at about 150,000 pounds. The truth is,
          there is no animal that has ever walked the earth that is more fitting to this description than a dinosaur.
        </p>
        <p style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;line-height: 1.5;font-size:16px;" class="indent">
          In the book of Job, we can also read of another creature that sounds very similar to a dinosaur-like, water-living reptile.
          God calls this creature “Leviathan.” He describes the animal to Job in chapter 41:
        </p>
        <p style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;line-height: 1.5;font-size:16px;" class="indent">
          <i>By his neesings [sneezings] a light doth shine, and his eyes are like the eyelids of the morning. Out of his mouth go burning lamps,
            and sparks of fire leap out. Out of his nostrils goeth smoke, as out of a seething pot or caldron.
            His breath kindleth coals, and a flame goeth out of his mouth.<sup style="font-size:10px;">2</sup>
          </i>
        </p>
        <p style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;line-height: 1.5;font-size:16px;" class="indent">
          <i>Sharp stones are under him: he spreadeth sharp pointed things upon the mire. He maketh the deep to boil like a pot:
            he maketh the sea like a pot of ointment. He maketh a path to shine after him; one would think the deep to be hoary.
            Upon earth there is not his like, who is made without fear.<sup style="font-size:10px;">3</sup>
          </i>
        </p>
        <p style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;line-height: 1.5;font-size:16px;" class="indent">
          What is this incredible creature God described in his conversation with Job? It is certainly like no other creature alive today.
          Some people believe that this creature could be a crocodile or a whale. But whales do not have
          “sharp stones" on their underside, and crocodiles do not have “burning lamps" that come from their mouths.
          This animal was a sea monster that lived not millions of years ago, but thousands of years ago when Job lived.
          It was probably a mosasaur or pliosaur, gigantic, oceanic, a reptilian predator that apparently breathed fire.
          Many people think that this creature is imaginary, but God talks about it along with other animals like the behemoth,
          the wild donkey, the ox, mountain goats, horses, lions, and hawks.
          The leviathan and behemoth were just another part of God’s glorious creation just like the other beasts of the land, sea, and air.
        </p>
        <p style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;line-height: 1.5;font-size:16px;" class="indent">
          <i>Surely the mountains bring him forth food, where all the beasts of the field play. He lieth under the shady trees,

        The <b>Canada Geese</b> or <b>Canadian Goose</b><sup style="font-size:10px;">1</sup> (<i>Branta canadensis</i>)
        lives in most of North America.
        These geese are distinguishable by a white band near their eyes on their black necks.
        These birds have a large wingspan, up to 5.6 feet long! When these birds migrate,
        they are renowned for their “V” shape when they fly south.

        The most amazing part about the Canada Goose is its ability to keep warm despite
        frigid temperatures. Many times, these geese stay in the northern states
        throughout the winter. The temperatures in the North often drop below 0⁰C.
        Swimming through ice-cold water or walking on freezing ice or snow sounds cold,
        and the last thing the geese would want is the freeze to death. Because of this,
        God, the Intelligent Designer (Yes, that’s right.
        It’s not Intelligent Evolution or Natural Selection),
        made these creatures an amazing way to stay toasty. When the heart begins to pump,
        warm blood circulates all around the body, the arteries
        (the blood vessels that go out from the heart), which carries warmer blood,
        passes by the veins (blood vessels that return to the heart) and by doing so,
        heat up the veins, which have cooled off. Using this process,
        all of the blood will begin to heat up, keeping the birds warm. Wow!
        No need for heaters.

        As always, these animals show the indescribable perfectness of the creation of God
        and show his intelligence and purposefulness in his creation.
