          <p style="" class="indent">
            What is <i>information</i>? It is a value stored in matter. For example, take a book.
            The paper and ink are the matter but the printed letters and symbols contain this value that our brains translate into words.
            The factor that differentiates information from matter is that they are a value that can be stored on a variety of matters.
            The value of “IOCS” can be stored on a digital device, paper, or even in your brain.
          </p>
          <p style="" class="indent">
            Similarly, genes are like “ink.” They store “words” or DNA.
          </p>
          <p style="" class="indent">
            Evolution only explains the beginning of matter, though in an unbelievable way.
            Creation, however, says in John 1:1 that “in the beginning was the Word.” This word is information.
            Creationism says that in the beginning, both matter and information existed.
          <p style="" class="indent">
            To add to evolution’s woes, the thing that manufactures genes is manufactured by information in genes!
            Phillip E. Johnson compares this to trying to make the first DVD reader and the reader’s instructions are in a DVD!<sup style="font-size:10px;">1</sup>
            This is impossible, so with evolution, no information can be made!
          </p>
          <p style="" class="doubleindent">
            Last but not least, evolution’s getaway device, mutations, cannot create information.
            First, <b>mutations can’t work on non-living things</b>, so evolution still can’t explain the creation of information.
            Second, even if evolution somehow did make information, it would end there. <b>Mutations cannot create brand new information</b>.<sup style="font-size:10px;">2</sup>
            Sure, they can make small kinks and errors, but that is all.
            No new legs. No new eyes. No new anythings. Just a soup of chemicals.
            Let’s stick with creation, shall we not?
          </p>

            <span style="margin-left:80px;margin-right:80px;">
            <p style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;line-height: 1.5;font-size:16px;" class="indent">
              The column, "Dinosaurs of Eden," had been revised into a bi-weekly article. Last week's article:
            </p>
            <p style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;line-height: 1.5;font-size:16px;" class="indent">
              Something to consider is chapter 40 of Job, in the Bible. God describes a creature that matches the physical attributes of some species of dinosaurs.
              While God is talking to Job, God asks him if he had seen the “behemoth.” God describes the animal by saying:
            </p>
            <i><p style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;line-height: 1.5;font-size:16px;" class="indent">
              “Behold now behemoth, which I made with thee; he eateth grass as an ox. Lo now, his strength is in his loins,
              and his force is in the navel of his belly. He moveth his tail like a cedar: the sinews of his stones are wrapped together.
              His bones are as strong pieces of brass; his bones are like bars of iron. He is the chief of the ways of God:
              he that made him can make his sword to approach unto him.”<sup style="font-size:10px;">1</sup>
            </p></i>
            <p style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;line-height: 1.5;font-size:16px;" class="indent">
              Certainly, no animal with the likes of these walks the earth today.
              Many dinosaurs definitely had “tails like cedar trees,” and “bones like beams of brass.”
              Some people would argue that the creature described by God could be a hippopotamus or an elephant,
              but these creatures undoubtedly do not have “tails like cedar trees.” Hippopotamus and elephants and have tiny stubby tails.
              And although the elephant would seem to be “the first of the works of God,” because of its immense weight of about 14,000 pounds,
              it is dwarfed by the titanic sauropods, weighing in at about 150,000 pounds. The truth is,
              there is no animal that has ever walked the earth that is more fitting to this description than a dinosaur.
            </p>
            <p style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;line-height: 1.5;font-size:16px;" class="indent">
              In the book of Job, we can also read of another creature that sounds very similar to a dinosaur-like, water-living reptile.
              God calls this creature “Leviathan.” He describes the animal to Job in chapter 41:
            </p>
            <p style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;line-height: 1.5;font-size:16px;" class="indent">
              <i>By his neesings [sneezings] a light doth shine, and his eyes are like the eyelids of the morning. Out of his mouth go burning lamps,
                and sparks of fire leap out. Out of his nostrils goeth smoke, as out of a seething pot or caldron.
                His breath kindleth coals, and a flame goeth out of his mouth.<sup style="font-size:10px;">2</sup>
              </i>
            </p>
            <p style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;line-height: 1.5;font-size:16px;" class="indent">
              <i>Sharp stones are under him: he spreadeth sharp pointed things upon the mire. He maketh the deep to boil like a pot:
                he maketh the sea like a pot of ointment. He maketh a path to shine after him; one would think the deep to be hoary.
                Upon earth there is not his like, who is made without fear.<sup style="font-size:10px;">3</sup>
              </i>
            </p>
            <p style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;line-height: 1.5;font-size:16px;" class="indent">
              What is this incredible creature God described in his conversation with Job? It is certainly like no other creature alive today.
              Some people believe that this creature could be a crocodile or a whale. But whales do not have
              “sharp stones" on their underside, and crocodiles do not have “burning lamps" that come from their mouths.
              This animal was a sea monster that lived not millions of years ago, but thousands of years ago when Job lived.
              It was probably a mosasaur or pliosaur, gigantic, oceanic, a reptilian predator that apparently breathed fire.
              Many people think that this creature is imaginary, but God talks about it along with other animals like the behemoth,
              the wild donkey, the ox, mountain goats, horses, lions, and hawks.
              The leviathan and behemoth were just another part of God’s glorious creation just like the other beasts of the land, sea, and air.
            </p>
            <p style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;line-height: 1.5;font-size:16px;" class="indent">
              <i>Surely the mountains bring him forth food, where all the beasts of the field play. He lieth under the shady trees,
                in the covert of the reed, and fens.<sup style="font-size:10px;">4</sup>

            A meadowhawk soars above. What is a meadowhawk? A bird of prey? A bird?
            Actually, it’s an insect. Oh… The Autumn Meadowhawk (<i>Sympetrum vicinum</i>) is a dragonfly that lives in America.
            There are many kinds of meadowhawks, all of which vary in color.
          </p>
          <p style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;line-height: 1.5;font-size:16px;" class="indent">
            There are many wonderful factors about these insects, here is one of them:
            Meadowhawk dragonflies dwell near water and thrive during the summer, which is when they are most needed.
            As many people know, mosquitoes, the dreaded, terrifying beasts, flourish during the summer.
            Instead of being a nuisance to meadowhawks, the dragonflies consider mosquitoes as a yummy snack.
            Amazingly (this applies to many dragonfly species), Meadowhawks eat mosquitos throughout their life cycle.
            After hatching, swimming in the cool water of a brook, these dragonfly nymphs (as dragonfly young are called)
            feast on mosquito larvae and mosquito pupae, which also live in water. And as adults, they eat mosquitoes.
            (Sadly though, I don’t think meadowhawks eat mosquitoes as eggs.)
          </p>
          <p style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;line-height: 1.5;font-size:16px;" class="indent">
            Once again, this shows the care that God has provided for us,
            for his ability to find an amazing way to limit the population of the fearsome mosquito,
            and for showing us the amazing workmanship in his creation.
          </p>
          <p style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;line-height: 1.5;font-size:16px;" class="indent">
              “<i>The earth is the <span style="font-family:'Capitals',Helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:14px;">Lord</span>'s,
                and the fulness thereof; the world, and they that dwell therein.</i>”<sup style="font-size:10px;">1</sup>
