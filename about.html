    Several articles are presented in each newsletter, written by young men and women dedicated to spreading the truth!
    They are filled with interesting facts, inspiring proofs of God's design, and most importantly, awesome testimonies of the Creator!

    Each quote is by no means the least of the newsletter, as in just a few sentences,
    it describes what others do in books.
