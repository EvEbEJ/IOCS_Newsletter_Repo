    Every newsletter includes a fun fact about science, nature, and anything related to creation.
    Each fact is submitted by readers and reviewed by us.
    With stunning graphics, this section is a sure eyecatcher!

    The first article of each newsletter is titled <i>Evolution Questioned</i>.
    It explains a common area in the creation-evolution controversy from a biblical perspective,
    often highlighting what God can show us through his work.
    </p></li>
  <li><p class="content">
    Another article is called <i>Dinosaur the of Week</i> (formerly known as <i>Dinosaurs of Eden</i>).
    This column explains facts about dinosaurs, how they go along with the Bible, and much more!
    It is an eye-opener, and usually discusses facts crucial to a creationist's faith.
    </p></li>
  <li><p class="content">
    <i>Exploring the Fossils</i> is a monthly column displaying how fossils refute the very idea of evolutionism.
    It often links the fossil with God's word, and gives incredibly detailed and picturesque descriptions.
    </p></li>
  <li><p class="content">
    <i>Civil Discourse</i> is also monthly. 
    This column focuses on the construction of a good argument, especially in terms of the creation-evolution debate.
    </p></li>
  <li><p class="content">
    The final article is known as <i>Creature of the Week</i>.
    Every week, one creature is discussed and explored.
    Ultimately, every animal points back to the Creator, and this article boldens it in full.
    </p></li>
  <li><p class="content">
    The articles are followed up by a fun and often entertaining comic strip aptly named "Creature Comics."
    Every week, these catchy comics illustrate a key principle in the creation-evolution controversy.
    </p></li>
  <li><p class="content">
    Currently, all newsletters conclude with a inspiring quote, which is often taken from the Bible or a famous scientist.
    Each quote is by no means the least of the newsletter, as in just a few sentences,
    it describes what others do in books. 
    </p></li>
  </ul>
